When cleaning up eligibility requirements, you must:

- Replace references to specific years with generic language (2023 -> last year)
- Replace uncertain language with certain language (you may qualify if -> you qualify if)
- Clarify logically ambiguous language (adult dependent -> dependent of any age)
