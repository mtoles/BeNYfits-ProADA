He is stoned from the time he sits down to dinner until he falls asleep. I have nothing against weed, but there are work issues for me. Don't care if he smokes sometimes, but now it is EVERY time we are together and we can't even have a normal conversation. Recently, he's started complaining that sex is no good because we aren't \"in sync\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter last post, I discussed the weed and sex issue with BF. I told him that I feel like the one of the reasons we are not in sync sometimes is because he is stoned every time and way far off in his own little world. I sometimes feel he's more trying to act out a porn movie with a stranger instead of being engaged with me, and that he becomes too rough and impersonal. He seemed surprised that I had those concerns and said he'd not smoke up so that we could be in the same state of mind. Later, sex ensues. Immediately afterward - like 2 minutes - he had to \"go to the bathroom\". Of course, he came back reeking of weed. I get that he might have wanted to get high to go to sleep; however, I can't help but feel irritated that he got up and left the room immediately after he got what he wanted and got high again. And, although he doesn't need to ask my permission, it would have been nice if he had asked if I minded considering we had a lengthy conversation about it before going to bed. I went to sleep feeling used and second place to weed.\n\nI'm thinking of asking him for a break until my work matters get settled and we can agree on what amount of smoking is ok when we are together.  I'm hoping that we can start spending some time together with him sober again becasue it has been really sad to see him go from who he was to a stoned zombie every night. If you substitute any other substance into the context of this situation (alcohol, prescription meds, etc.) this would be labeled addiction. I realize that weed doesn't hold that stigma, yet I am sitting on the sofa every evening watching Cartoon Network with no hope of intelligent conversation.  I'm losing respect for him.\n\nAnyone have any experience with this? Can come to an agreement, or it is better to start looking for an exit from this relationship? I am fully willing to compromise, but he seems unable to put it aside for even one night.  Even if my situation allows me to participate again, I know I don't want it in my life on an everyday basis.\n\nOther info:\n\n1. We only spend 50% of our time together, so he also has  plenty of time to do this when I'm not around.  I don't understand why he has to be stoned the entire time that we are together.\n2. I am fairly positive that he was not hiding excessive use from me when we first met and that this habit has evolved from casual use a couple times a week to 3 or 4 times per night over the past six months. He is much different when he's stoned and not good at hiding it.\n3. The ease and convenience of using a vape pen with high THC may be contributing to the problem. He has no interest in switching products or methods - we have discussed this.","1":"This actually happened today, so maybe I broke the internet or something.\n\nMy husband and I went out to eat at one of our favorite restaurants tonight. As we were getting ready to order, another server on the floor approached ours to let her know that the restaurant was out of the rib special for the night. Our server had just left our table for the kitchen when we heard a plate crash on the floor in the back.\n\nWe both made the obligatory sad faces before my husband joked and said, \"Maybe they'll tell us that they are also out of plates for the night.\"\n\nI laughed, but added, \"You know that's a real trend, right? It's a hipster thing to serve food on non-plate items.\"\n\nAt first he thought I was joking, but I assured him that it was very real. So while we were waiting, I pulled up a few listicles that showed restaurant items being served on everything from miniature staircase sculptures to shoes.\n\nHowever, the one \"no plate\" item that caught his eye was the shovel. He was thoroughly amused by the idea of eating a meal served on a shovel and became obsessed with making it a reality. He started searching online for plate-sized shovels and made the worst jokes like, \"I sure can't wait to shovel all that food in my mouth.\" I'm genuinely concerned that I'm going to come home to a giant box of shovels.\n\n\n\nUpdate: Thanks to \/u\/possiblymakingshitup and \/u\/lmaes246, I now have a shovel-spoon flatware set on its way to be delivered by the end of the day.\n\nFinal update: If there's anyone out there still playing in Internetland, he LOVED the shovel silverware set and said he can't wait to use it. The mini shovels seem to have distracted him from using actual shovels as plates. :)","2":"I've recently started work at a cafe,  I'm new to the hospitality scene, and ngl it can be stressful. I mostly help out in the kitchen while they train me to be a good waiter. Also important to note,  I'm vegetarian, and have been for quite a while now,  but I haven't told any of the people I work with because I'm awkward I guess?  So today one of the guys was making a pizza, and he asked me to go into the fridge and get him some more ham, \"sure!  No worries\" I said how hard could that be?  So I walk around into The walk in fridge, up to where they keep all the meat and-\n\nOh god.  I don't know what ham looks like.  It's like,  that circle meat shit right? Fuck,  I spend 3 minutes looking for this god damn ham, now I'm sweating in a fridge for crying out loud,  where's the ham?  What does ham look like? Now I'm panicking, so I see some bacon. Tomato tomato right?  I run out and as he's working on the pizzas hold out the bacon to him \"I couldn't find the ham..  Is this what you meant? \" now he has this real confused look on his face and I realise not only did I not bring him ham,  I brought him FROZEN BACON.  ALL WRAPPED UP.  If this wasn't shameful enough,  another colleigue takes me back to the fridge to 'help me find the ham' and she walks in and grabs one of the 10 bags of that, long,  stippy meat, that was sitting at eye level the whole time,  giving me that long weird look you give to people who eat burgers separate from the Patty, before leaving me dumbfounded alone in the fridge.","3":"Migraine Mim and FIL texted DH asking how much time in advance he would need to request 3-4 days off work for them to visit. He told them any time this year would be difficult as we just found out we're moving as well as expecting baby #3 in September. They were of course excited and congratulated us but still would like to come visit. I shut it down and said not until she can apologize for the way she has treated us as adults, as a couple, and as parents as well as apologize for the way she has treated me in the past. \n\nAbout an hour later, DH received a Facebook message from someone we didn't know telling us congratulations on the pregnancy. Mim had posted in on her Facebook thinking that because we both had her blocked we wouldn't find out. He immediately texts FIL telling him to ask Mim to take it down as we weren't going to announce it yet and it wasn't her place to do so. He said he'd take care of it. Like naive little idiots, we believed it.\n\n14 hours and three congratulations later and the post is still up. Luckily one of her friends realized Mim was in the wrong and tattled on her letting us no it was still up. Pretty sure she had a justno of her own. DH texted FIL again but got Mim. Their conversation is as follows.\n\nDH: I keep getting congrats for the new baby from people on fb I asked nothi g to be posted and if there is a post take it down or don't bother coming if your not going to abide by my request\n\nMim: This is mom. I already removed it. So supposedly you don't use Facebook why does it bother you all so much that I mentioned a new addition to the family? I have abided by not posting pics....because even if that was okay....you don't share any with us anyways. I did not post who was having the baby as it could have been BILs. That is what really hurts is all of the family can share pics and talk about their grandchildren but We are not allowed. So please tell raerae to get her \"Friend\" off my list.\n\nDH: Don't lie to me I've got YOUR friend that is messaging ME about it still being up. HOW DARE YOU LIE TO ME. TAKE IT DOWN NOW!!!!!!\n\nMim: It is down and don't you Ever yell and swear at me again like a immature child. So please grow up and until you want to talk civilly about what is really bothering you we will be here. I'm dealing with enough bullshit right now but hey that doesn't seem to revolve around you unless it's You. Give our love to the boys and we pray everyone including baby stay healthy and happy.\n\nDH: I didn't swear at all. Nice to know you listen. Wow you sound like (narc aunt Mim hates) at this moment making you the victim when I asked a simple question about my family. So why don't you grow up and respect me as a parent about my family. And don't lie to me about anything when it comes to my family.\n\nThis is really the first time that DH has shown his shiny spine to his mom. This has been building for 5 years. Finally I feel like he's standing up for us as a family.\n\nI was gonna add her email and post sicking her friends on us but this is already getting too long so I'll probably post it separately.","4":"Obligatory, \"it happened a few years ago\", not today. \n\nI started the school year late due to a surgery, so I was unfamiliar with all the new kids at the start of term. On my first day back, I hit it off with this Asian kid who was really nice, but for some reason everyone else thought I was stupid befriending him. \n\nDuring lunch break, we're getting along well when he announces to the room that he's going to throw something in the bin, and that no one touch his sandwich. When someone makes a demand like that, a good rule of thumb is to follow it, but that's not what I did. As he went to the bin, I thought it was a good idea to *fucking touch the goddamn sandwich*. \n\nWhat happened next still blows my mind. In the most absurd act of rage I've ever seen, he charges towards me, socks me in the face, takes his sandwich back, lifts his chair up while tears and spittle stream down his face, and proceeds to throw it at the glass window. He then swipes clean the teachers desk, sending paper and electronics flying, all while yelling something unintelligible. \n\nAfter the show of queer dominance, I noped the fuck out of there. \n\nTurns out that kid had ADHD, was a hygiene freak, had anger management issues and suffered from depression and went into drugs a few years after he was expelled. I don't want to think that I started it all by touching his fucking sandwich. \n\n\n\nEdit: I understand that ADHD was not the root cause of it. He apparently had numerous issues alongside ADHD, but he was unstable. I did end up stopping him from jumping off the 5th floor when he got rejected by the hottest girl in the year, so I guess we're even...?\n\nEdit 2: A few of you wanted more stories of \"Ryan\", so here you go:\n\n* Ryan called his homeroom teacher a 'biatch'. He was fond of the word, and since this was 7th grade, the teacher let him off telling him not to use that word with adults.\n\n* In a music class, the teacher paired us such that each pair had one person good at playing the instrument (I think it was a small clarinet), and another who wasn't as skilled. Unknowingly, she paired Ryan with another ADHD kid he absolutely detested, Josh. Josh was really good at playing the instrument, and tuned out Ryan when he asked to share the clarinet, which absolutely pissed him off. He dug through his bag and stabbed Josh in the forearm with a pair of scissors, drawing blood and a piercing scream from Josh. Everyone stopped playing and saw the blood trailing down from Josh's arm. The teacher took one look and sent for help. Josh took a few days off school, and had to make sure he didn't get infected from the scissors. Ryan was suspended for two weeks and was sent to anger management again. Oh, and he called the teacher a 'biatch'.\n\n* A kid made a \"yo mamma\" joke about Ryan, and the hottest girl in the year rejected him, which I guess was too much for Ryan. He decided to jump off the fifth floor five minutes before homeroom, when literally the whole school was going to class. So it was half our class outside telling him to get the fuck down while the entire floor just watched. He got down, and this other kid and I got a cheap medal and a phone call home due to \"excellent counseling in a time of crisis\". Ryan was suspended for an indeterminate amount of time while the school got their shit together and decided to move him to another school.\n\nI'm so glad this country has solid gun control.","5":"I\u2019ve known my current GF for about a year. We met through friends and were casual acquaintances. She was dating someone sort of on\/off and he put an end to it just before Christmas of last year. We stayed casual acquaintances until this summer and then began seeing each other. Official for four months. \n\nFriends have commented on her \u201codd habits\u201d that have ruined relationships in the past. At drinks, a few of my friends warned me. That was followed-up by one of girlfriends asking me to give her an honest chance. \n\nFrom the outside, she looks completely, totally, normal. She\u2019s amazing looking, well poised and just a really great sociable person. When we\u2019re alone, she\u2019s a lot more confessional about her social anxiety, esp. worried about hurting people\u2019s feelings and worried she\u2019s committed some transgressions. All things I\u2019ve dealt with in a relationship before. She has mild\/moderate OCD which she gets therapy for.  \n\nI guess her odd behavior or habit is that she has this thing where she likes to play with my hair, for hours on end. We can watch a movie with her playing with my hair. She keeps asking if it bothers me or if I am annoyed. It neither bothers nor annoys me. \n\nI finally asked my friends to clarify and they went through a litany of \u201cweird\u201d things. She does every single one of them.\n \n* She does talk to her cats; \n\n* She is fastidious with folding clothes (it\u2019s impressive to watch); \n\n* She gets flustered easily in social situations and begins to profusely sweat; \n\n* She has an odd habit of sleeping with her arm under her SO\/ my clothes; \n\n* She gets very \u201ccomfortable\u201d around her SOs pretty quickly; \n\n* She\u2019s very direct about how she envisions her future; \n\n* She has a bit of a \u201cwild\u201d past; \n\n* She talks to herself (she\u2019ll do it when she doesn\u2019t think anyone is around\/notices); \n\n* She orders\/alphabetizes everything and will fix it if it gets out of order; \n\n* Her fridge is all put into special containers and ordered by categories  (sauces in sauce section, meats in meats, leftovers with leftovers);\n\n* She brushes her teeth ~3 or 4 times a day; \n\n* She can be very forthright: she\u2019ll ask (rhetorically) if she has bad BO then smell her pits, can\u2019t decide and then ask me. \n\nNone of this strikes me as critically odd\/Red Flag, but everyone seems to think I'm blind to it..... Am I? Am I missing flags here?\n\nI met her parents and they\u2019re lovely people who seemed a bit\u2026 like maybe I was going to dump her, too. They were very lovely but guarded, made sure I knew she was a really great girl, etc. \n\nAm I totally off the wall or are my\/her friends just conjuring crap in their minds? \n\n  \n  ---   \n  **","6":"I met this guy we\u2019ll call \u201cJustin\u201d about a year ago. We run in the same arts scene, and he was friends with my SO so I was friendly with him at first. After getting to know him a bit better, I started picking up on a ton of red flags that I really try to avoid in friendships and men in general. He\u2019s superficially charming, but he\u2019s got a fragile ego, and short temper. He\u2019s pushy, confrontational, and misogynistic. On top of that, he\u2019s *sincerely* not very good at what we do, and he doesn\u2019t take constructive criticism well. He\u2019s burned some bridges, and several people have spoken to him about his lack of professionalism. I hope I\u2019m not coming across as really bitchy here, but I\u2019ve dealt with a ton of people like him in my career, and I\u2019m out of patience. \n\nI was able to maintain a friendly relationship with him for a while, but he has slowly pushed me into the \u201cthis guy makes my skin crawl\u201d territory. The first time I ran into him at a show without my SO he said \u201cwhere\u2019s so-and-so? I guess this means I can hit on you now!\u201d I brushed it off as a bad joke at the time, but seriously he\u2019s a grown-ass man who should know better than that at this point. There\u2019s a lot of grey area in my industry, but it\u2019s still my job and there\u2019s so many layers of disrespect there.\n\nAnother time at a party I was catching up with an old friend of mine from out of town in the hallway, away from the action, where we very obviously wanted privacy. \u201cJustin\u201d waltzes over and cuts me off to say \u201cI just have to interrupt, because your friend here is so beautiful.\u201d Again, I chalked it up to bad game, but this time I said something about it. I tried to have a sincere conversation with him about how his actions make me and other women feel, and he got extremely defensive. He said he can\u2019t help but hit on pretty girls all the time, because he\u2019s \u201cjust a caveman\u201d and that\u2019s how he\u2019s wired. There was no getting through to him.\n\nI don\u2019t want to write a novel here, but I\u2019ve been trying to keep my distance from him for a while. I\u2019ll say a polite hello when we run into each other, but I don\u2019t engage him in conversation. I really don\u2019t see a reason I should have to interact with him beyond that, but now it seems my coldness is pissing him off. For the past two weeks or so, he keeps trying to \u201chave a chat\u201d with me, but the way he\u2019s going about it makes me uncomfortable. First, he cornered me at a show and tried to invite himself over to my apartment. He said \u201cyou\u2019re free in the afternoons, right? I can just swing by.\u201d Most recently, he chased me out of a show shouting my name and calling me rude. He frightens me, and the thought of having to say that to his face frightens me even more. Should I try sending him a message? What can I say that won\u2019t just make things worse?","7":"First time poster here. This was one of the scariest days of my life.\n\nSome needed info: This one's from way back to my high-school years. I was 3rd year when this happened. My school is an old private school which is literally located smacked in the middle of a jungle. It takes literally 15-20 minute drive to the town.\n\nWe all have had those Science projects right? So on my 3rd year of high-school, I decided to do something ambitious. It was pretty much an attempt to collect native plants from my area and see if they have any potential as a bio-fuel source. I also wanted to work alone because I just wanted to.\n\nInitially, everything was going smoothly as according to plan. My proposal was approved, the school gave me permission to use the lab after class hours, I had access to some chemicals that were hard to come-by, and I got help with collecting the different plant samples.\n\nSo pretty much, the process involves me \"extracting\" any fuel components from plant matter using a chemical called N-HEXANE. It pretty much acts as a co-solvent. To spare you any of the rather deeper details, it involved usage heat while mixing in the N-HEXANE. My school's chem lab was a separate building from the main campus.\n\nMy first few weeks were great. Some plants barely produced anything while there were some promising ones. On a chill Tuesday afternoon though, I attempted to continue my project groggy and lacking some sleep. Spent the night before playing Left 4 Dead and Civ 4 with friends. That was were I made my first mistake. I proceeded to do the ritual cleaning of equipment, setting up the distillation stuff (you know, the works), and preparing the plant samples.\n\nEverything was going fine up until the point I needed to add the N-HEXANE to the plant now crushed plant mass. The plant mass was inside a flask that was being heated over a bunsen burner. Stupid sleepy me forgot to prepare the N-HEXANE which was kept nicely in chilled cabinet\/refrigerator thingy, so I immediately rushed to grab it, pour a few ml to a small beaker, and pour it into the flask. \n\nThat's were I made my second mistake. What happens when you have a heated piece of glass that gets subjected to something cold? Yup. It shatters. And boy did it shatter like the 4th of fucking July. The moment the glass broke, the plant mass and the N-HEXANE immediately caught fire. Pieces of glass hit dug into my skin with some hitting sinking deep into my face. Thankfully I had goggles so my eyes were spared. That wasn't the worst part though. The fire that erupted outward had burnt my hair and areas of my face. I fell down to the ground and the whole table was on fire.\n\nI tried to quickly get up by grabbing onto the table and pulling myself up. Third mistake. There was shattered glass on the table and it cut through my glove and straight into my right hand. I panicked like there was no tomorrow and in the process, I hit the bunsen burner and it disconnects the rubber hose from it. Fire quickly jumped onto the streaming gas. The main pipes that supplied gas started bursting with fire. That's when I knew I was really fucked. I just got down and took cover under the cement lab table I was working on and prayed it'd be alright when suddenly- I heard a loud bang and the lab shook.\n\nI took a few moments before slowly getting up. The school's fire alarm was roaring. I was delirious and in pain. There was huge hole in the very back of the lab. Fire, glass, and rubble was everywhere. Took all my focus just to get out of the building and when I got out, there were security guards all over the place. \n\nSpent the next few weeks recovering and explaining to the school administration what the hell just happened. Thankfully, my family didn't have to pay too much for the damages and all I got was detention. Ended up changing projects to something related to composting and lemons.","8":"[First post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/3yhvlz\/me_25m_with_my_ex_25f_of_3_months_i_want_her_out\/)\n\nSo, after evaluating all the advice from fellow redditors as well as my wise step-father, I decided to lay down the law:\n\n* I'm giving her until the end of January (so 1 month) to be moved out.\n* I'm keeping the new car and not going to hassle with trying to lease it to her.  I'm going to pull all my fancy audio equipment out of my otherwise worthless rustbucket that I've been driving and just give that to her since it's paid off and I don't want to pay insurance on two cars anyways.\n* I remembered that she is still on my cellphone plan; she will either get her own plan or go back on her mother's.  For now, her data is turned off because I got a notice from the carrier that she used 5gb out of the shared 6gb only halfway through the billing cycle (that's what reminded me about the phone lol).\n\nThe conversation conveniently started a few minutes after I turned off her phone's data, because apparently her phone was failing to authenticate to my wifi.  I took that opportunity to switch her over to my segregated guest network (yay, now I can clean up some of the firewall rules I built before because I didn't feel like talking to her about switching to my guest network . . . hell, I wouldn't put it past myself to have blocked her from getting on the main SSID specifically so this would happen, but I honestly don't remember doing that).  I'll admit I felt a little bad about instantly assuming she was purposefully using the data and shutting it off, but I didn't go back on that decision and she didn't ask me too.\n\nI felt like I had to be a bit of a dick about to the point across that her problems are *hers* and I shouldn't be responsible for them anymore.  She complained again about not having anywhere to go, so I told her exactly what several other people had pointed out:  \"I'm pretty sure you do; they just aren't as nice.\"\n\nShe huffed and told me to call her brother and convince her to share his room, but I stood my ground and told her that she has to figure that out on her own.  She huffed some more but realized that she doesn't have much of an argument here.\n\nThen she thought the conversation was over and started to walk away, but I told her we needed to talk about the car too.  She was not happy at all when I said that we're going to switch the cars around and I'm essentially going to give her a functioning (albeit probably barely) vehicle for free.  She expressed concern about getting the short end of the stick there because she is going from getting to drive a new car for free to driving a rustbucket for free (and actually owning it and having to pay insurance).  Well, you know what's worse than driving a rustbucket?  Driving nothing.  So take what you can get, because I'm being really generous just giving away a car that I could keep around as a spare or get some cash from a junkyard for if I wanted to.\n\nShe's still upset because she really wanted to the new car and really thought she'd be able to lease it and make payment, but I explained to her that I'm not willing to remain liable for her driving when we aren't even going to be living together.  Not to mention the fact that I don't trust her to make timely and full payments on anything ever.  I'm just going to eat the loss on the debt that I foolishly absorbed from her worthless trade-in.  I gotta live with the consequences of my mistakes as well I guess.\n\nI truly hate that Kia Soul, but I guess I'll have to get used to it.  Maybe it will be better if I get some blindspot mirrors and upgrade the stereo (hopefully reusing most of what I already bought for the old Cavalier).\n   \n**\n\n**PS**: And thanks to the person who suggested that I check out this sub in the first place.  If you're reading this, you know who you are. ;)  You're awesome!\n\nedit:  Wow, wasn't expecting this to get so much attention.  Thanks so much for all the kind words and further encouragement and advice!

Thanks again everybody!","9":"Original post [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/8547ag\/my_boyfriend_25m_cannot_handle_being_alone_when_i\/).\n\nIt's been eight months, and I thought I'd give an update.\n\nFirst of all, we're still together. The advice was overwhelmingly along the lines of \"this is a major problem and will not go away\" - and I agreed with it at the time. However, after posting, I decided to wait a bit just to see how things went because I really liked the guy.\n\nThere are a couple of things that affected his behaviour that I didn't really understand before:\n\n* He is not fulfilled by his work, and so any time not spent in work is really important to him and he wants to make the most of it\n\n* Most of his close friends are big drinkers, and he was trying to cut back. This meant that he was not seeing his friends as often as all they do is go out on the weekend together. \n\nThese two things together meant that he was alone a lot more than he used to be and he was feeling frustrated in general. So here's what has happened since:\n\nOver the summer, I wasn't in classes anymore and we spent a lot of time together. This sort of goes against intuition, as I thought more time apart would be better. But there are a lot of days when I don't feel like doing anything, so if he wanted to spend time with me, that meant that he had to come up with something to do while I was reading or sewing or doing whatever on my own. He got comfortable with watching something or reading something while I was sitting there doing my own thing.\n\nHe figured out how to hang out with his friends without making it a big drinking night. They started going out to dinner once in a while. He would go out with them occasionally and just not drink as much and go home early. I think this really helped him not feel so alone.\n\nHe came to terms with how unfulfilling his job is and he's currently working to fix that. A few months ago, we started having some honest conversations about what he really wanted to do, and he was trying to figure that out for a while. Well now he has a solid plan of getting to that new career, and while it will take some time, he gets so excited just talking about it. I think this has helped tremendously.\n\nThanks to everyone who commented. I think everyone was exactly right that it was a pretty major problem, which is why I posted. I appreciate everyone telling me that though. Sometimes you need to hear that. I'm glad I gave it a chance to fix itself though. I honestly couldn't be happier in my relationship than I am now.","10":"So my ILs are very religious, and don't want us to live together. They gave us a car as an early bday present and two weeks later told us it was on the condition we don't live together first... we are saving up for a new one. \n\nAnyway, we haven't planned to move in together until FH has a job (I don't make much and would have difficulty covering both of us) or we get married (and accumulate gift money) so he is at home. ILs bought a new house and are trying to sell their old house. FBIL (younger) is going to move in to the new house while the parents live in the old house as they try to sell. FH was planning to move into the new house until we get married in August. It's a really nice house! \n\nFH and BIL were discussing setting up the internet at the new house and how they would divide housework and cooking when House Kitty struck. She told FH that he had to stay at the old house with his parents until the house was sold \"In case he needed help\". He is a grown as man, but apparently he needs more help than his little brother!? \n\nHe told her he would move into the new house but would be able to drive back if House Kitty needed any help, but she got angry and said \"Why would I ask for your help? You spend all your time with Pokedoob, you're not around to help. \nis it so wrong for me to ask you to stay with us? Your place is not at the new house.\" Yea lady, that's weird. \n\nGood Ol' FH told her that, if his place wasn't at the new house, he may as well just move straight in with me because it would be more efficient, and walked out, so I don't know how she reacted. \n\nLater on, when discussing moving furniture, FMIL ask FH if he wanted a new bed in his room. He said it's didn't matter because he wouldn't be there long. House Kitty replied \"yes, I know you will only be there 2-3years but that's enough time to justify a new bed\". We are getting married IN AUGUST!!! In under 6 months!!!\n\nHe told her this and said that if she wanted a new guest bed then to go for it, but he is fine with the guest bed until August. House Kitty replied \"but you don't want to have to sleep In pokedoobs old bed and sleep poorly. We will get you a new bed and you can stay here for a bit longer. You are too young to have a bad sleep\". Um my bed was $6000 and is EXTREMELY comfortable, and no, he isn't going to decide to post pone the wedding because of a bed! \n\nArgh, I know she is just having some problems letting him go, but it's getting kind of ridiculous! FH thought it was so stupid he didn't even want to tell me at first because he knew I would rage!","11":"I wanted to post this for two reasons. \n1. I feel like there is misinformation circulating about IUDs and wanted to share my experience in case it is helpful to someone else. \n2. I am honestly sick and tired of the often-encountered medical agenda to push hormonal birth control are young women without thoroughly reviewing possible side effects. \n\nI had Skyla (the smallest Progestin IUD) inserted 3 weeks ago.  About 10 days after insertion I noticed a sudden and drastic mood change.  The first bout of this lasted three days where I was irritable, very easily moved to cry and had an all around low mood.  I have been a bit up and down since then, but have noted having \"bad days\" about 2 out of 3 days where before I would have a \"bad day\" like this maybe once a month.  My boyfriend also noticed this sudden and drastic change.  I have also felt fatigued, despite getting 8-9 hours of sleep each night.  It's important to note that there have been no significant stressors or changes in my life during this time that might otherwise account for this change. \n\nMood and energy levels can easily be discounted, but my boobs have literally quadrupled in size since beginning this BC just a few weeks ago.  My bras no longer fit, they are very sore, and feel so heavy.  I have always been rather small chested, which I actually like, and now feel like I have a full chest.  My boyfriend has noticed this as well. \n\nToday, I went to the doctor to have the IUD removed.  I am still shaking because of the absolute condescension, pressure, and shame that I was met with before I was able to get the IUD removed.  The physician told me that my mood could not be affected by this BC, and it must have been something else (despite me having no mood issues in the past several years and having a history of BC-induced mood changes in my early 20's).  She told me my breast enlargement was not \"objective\" and implied it was either in my head or caused by something else (despite me never having breasts this large save when I waist college and on another hormonal BC).  She asked me repeatedly how I planned on avoiding pregnancy and reiterated that this was the best method for doing so.  \n\nI told her that I had gone into the IUD with major concerns about hormonal BC, but was convinced by gyro who told me it was a very small amount that would be localized to my uterus.  That after witnessing these changes I can tell it is not localized to my uterus, and I do not want body influenced by outside hormones.  At this point (since this was a university health center), she asked me what I was studying with a condescending tone that implied I had no understanding of how these medications work.  I look very young but am actually a professor with a PhD in Health Psychology.  However, I felt too ashamed to say this given the tone of the conversation and simply said I had already graduated with a degree in psychology.  She then told me birth control had been well studied for 50 years and the evidence is in, it is safe.  I do not disagree that this may be \"safe\" for most people, but I have had several negative experiences that lead me to believe it is not something I want in my body.  Finally, as a last ditch effort, she said \"Ok, I will remove it.  It is just such a shame because they are so expensive.\"  \n\nI am leaving out several parts because I feel like this is already too long, but I am hoping to convey how condescending and pressured this entire experience was.  I felt as though my doctor did not listen to me about my own body, my own values, and my own experiences.  Although research done by the pharmaceutical companies may say otherwise, I know myself and my body and what effects this medication had on me.  There's already been a post about this today, but LISTEN TO YOURSELF.  And don't be afraid to advocate for what you want.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far :)","12":"i purchased a lake house in the same town as my somewhat estranged family about 5 years ago... i'd never had a relationship with my cousin prior to this (me growing up out state) and it seemed like a great opportunity to rekindle with my relatives and enjoy the lake\/nature.  \n\nThe lake is a very popular lake, and my cousin had a slip at the marina + pontoon before i moved.. A slip is about $3k a year... He runs a lawn service and doesn't have a lot of money, so we made a deal where he could dock his boat at my dock in exchange for taking care of the garden.  \n\nOver the years, he mows about 10 times a summer and that's it.. he does a pretty poor job, running over dog toys, not edging etc..\nHe lets family and friends use his boat, so there's people coming and going every day.. There's been a couple situations where his friends left the gate open and my dog got out (3x last summer)..\n\nI feel I have no privacy, and the deal isn't really beneficial to me.. My cousin is a known 'hot head' and could stop talking to me if i end it.... It would definitely put a strain on our relationship.  \n\nWhat do I do? How can i stop our agreement without hurting our relationship? I have plenty of other minor grievences, but he's not the type to fix them.. I would like to stop him docking his boat over the summer and find someone else to do the lawn work.  \n\n**\n\n**edit:** Thanks everyone for the great advice.  Per the majority of suggestions my plan is to talk to him ASAP and let him know that I need to cancel the arrangement next year and try to leave the conversation at that.. If he insists on me giving a reason I'lll use the loss of privacy, my desire to refurb the dock and finally the insurance \/ increased liability it causes.","13":"So first of all, throwaway because I'm pretty sure best friend uses reddit.\n\nBackground:\nI began dating my fiance, who we'll call M, 7 years ago, when she was 20 and I was 21. At the time M was roommates with her best friend, R, and R's boyfriend of 10 years (they'd literally been \"dating\" since they were 10) B. \n\nI immediately became close with B. We shared lots of hobbies, video game favorites, etc... M, B, R and myself all became close friends. \n5 years ago, B was diagnosed with late stage cancer. Things hit him hard and quick and by the end of the year he was gone. This crushed both M and myself, but obviously no one more then R. \n\nFrom that point on, R began to spiral. She managed to cling on to her GPA and maintain her masters program for a bit, but didn't stick it out for long because of her massive depression and eventual alcoholism. R began therapy and all of our friend group was there for her. M and myself went numerous times to her house (which was bought for her by her parents thank god) because she called us at all hours of the night. \n\nOver the years, R has not gotten better. She has lost jobs and friends. Luckily she has an inheritance from her grandmother that will last her a long time. But even her parents have stopped talking to her and now her only friend is M, and by extension, me. \n\nMy fiance dedicates so much time to making sure R is okay. R has become a hardcore, nonfunctional alcoholic. She does nothing for herself. M stocks her fridge every week to make sure she has food (but somehow R has time to get alcohol). Her phone is on at all hours of the night because R calls her from strange and dangerous places needing to be picked up. A few times we have sat vigil in the ICU. \n\nPlease don't get me wrong. I love M and I love her dedication to her friend. But we have not been on a vacation since B died because R might need her. M has missed so many days of work because of R. R ruined our engagement party by getting too drunk and crying about her own lost love... and M drove her home instead of staying with me. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where I think I need to put my foot down. I'm not trying to make M cut off R, just set healthy boundaries of any friendship. Anytime I bring this up M gets defensive. I understand why. But I can't deal with it anymore and I don't think M can either.\n\nBasically I'm asking for advice about talking to M in a constructive manner. I'm trying to come from a place of compassion for R and not resentment. I just want what's best and healthiest from my fiance. Any advice is welcome","14":"X post from relationships\n\nI went to college for computer engineering, and got a job in the industry afterwards. In college, my internships, and my job, I've dealt with sexual harassment and I've had to get tough with people, telling them to stay the fuck away when I get the first whiff of sketchiness.\n\nEvery time I've gotten a creepy text or instant message from another student or co worker, I've screenshotted it and backed it up in google drive just in case it escalates. That's helped me a few times, when someone started to follow me around in college, and when someone took things so far at work that I decided to go to HR. I don't report most of the shit though, I don't want it to look bad like I'm always running to HR.\n\nLast night, I got really drunk with my friend because I had a day off planned for today. I went home in a kinda bad mood because we'd been talking about how she was going through similar shit at work. I was in a \"fuck it all\" mood, and I uploaded my whole folder of screenshotted text messages to Facebook and Instagram, with the caption \"Phone &amp; Inbox of a female computer engineer.\" And tagged all the men who had sent me messages, whose social media I could find.\n\nSome of the highlights were...\n\nA bunch of married men hitting on me, and me replying \"dude you're married\" or something along those lines.\n\nSome guys asking me out and then taking rejection badly.\n\nSome guys who would text me repeatedly even though I'd just replied \"Don't contact me, other than for work purposes\"\n\nSexually explicit messages, or messages commenting on my appearance out of the blue.\n\nOverall, just messages from people ignoring my wishes to be left alone.\n\nThis morning, I woke up to my phone blowing up. (I had planned to take a vacation day off work today). A lot of the guys I'd tagged in my social media posts had contacted me demanding or pleading that I remove the posts. Most everyone had untagged themselves.\n\nThe Facebook post had gotten some attention from my friends, but my two Instagram posts (I had to make 2 to fit all the photos) had blown up. I had a lot of new followers, a lot of strangers commenting on my post, mostly supportive.\n\nI also had a email from HR at work asking me to meet with them first thing Monday morning. I replied to say that I would. I don't know what to expect there at all. I have not replied to any other messages about my posts.\n\nI need some advice. Should I speak to the guys who texted me about the posts? Some are very angry with me because they are married and their wives found out. I'm thinking it's safest to not. Should I leave the posts up, or remove them? Or wait to see how things go with HR before I decide? Should I be worried for my safety? I feel a little nervous but I don't know if I'm overreacting.","15":"I'm sure this or some variant of this story has been posted before, but I did my best to search and didn't come up with anything quite close enough.\n\nMy fiance and I are both from different states, and it just so happens that a handful of his high school classmates and friends have also ended up in the area. We have a group of six or seven of us that hang out on the regular, and this includes a few of my own friends from undergrad (I went to college in the area). \n\nOne girl from his hometown, \"Anna,\" isn't someone he was ever close with while he was in high school, but we've hung out with her and her husband \"John,\" since they moved here a year or so ago. Anna has tried really, really hard with me. She wants to be friends, so I try to reciprocate this, but the issue is that no one can stand her husband.\n\nHe isn't a mean guy, but he is arrogant and irritating. He wants to tell everyone how to live their lives, criticizes people if they say they are \"proud of their heritage,\" criticizes people for getting married before their wedding day, tries to explain how computers work to electrical engineers (he just took a six-week IT course), is generally inflammatory, and is a textbook example of the Dunning Kruger effect.\n\nI don't believe my friend group is being hypersensitive here, as I know through the grapevine (and through Anna herself) that most people from their hometown had the same issue with John. I have friends in this group who rarely have anything negative to say about anyone, and even they have expressed a desire to never be around John.\n\nSo here's the issue. My group plans things a lot of get togethers and excursions, and while I'd like to include Anna, no one is on board if John is going to be there. This is extra hard when you consider that most of these people in my group are from the same small town as Anna and John, so it's not like she has never met them. I've managed to just hang out with her one on one of late, but I really don't like worrying that someone is going to post about our get-togethers on social media where Anna could find out that we didn't invite her and John, and I know micromanaging everyone's social media posts isn't the answer either.\n\nI know Anna is somewhat aware of the effect John has on people, as she's said things to the effect of, \"oh I wouldn't blame anyone for not wanting to be around John.\" We all have theories about why she's with someone like him, but anyway... I'm not sure how to handle this. \n\nMy current plan is just to keep going on as is, and if she ever asks about it I'll be honest, but I don't know if that's the right move. Has anyone else dealt with this? How'd you handle it, and would you do anything differently?\n\n\n\nEdit: original post didn't make it clear that I also do not like John, and have no interest in forcing myself or anyone else to be around him.","16":"I have a best friend \"Kimberly\" that I've known since pre-school. Inseparable ever since, she's like the sister I've never had, etc. You get the picture. \n\nAnyways Kimberly has had a few boyfriends over the years, but her first serious one, first love, was Kyle. They met senior year in college. They were nutso crazy about each other. I became friends with Kyle by association, he's a pretty good dude, and I liked him for my friend. They were together for almost two years when Kimberly broke up with him. \n\nIt wasn't over anything scandalous or terrible, it was just basic but insurmountable incompatibility. (One wants kids, the other is childfree and they both have VERY different sex drives). \n\nEven though Kimberly initiated the breakup, she was absolutely crushed and devastated. She had wanted to marry Kyle (and he wanted to marry her), but realized it would never work in the long run, and better to end it now then drag it out for years or get married and then get divorced.\n\nI was proud of her but I hurt right along with her. It was just a sad and shitty situation because both of them are good people, just not right for each other. It messed her up bad and took her a very long time to recover from. \n\nAlmost a year later, Kimberly cautiously decided to go on a date with a guy she met at her rock climbing gym. They hit it off, sparks flew and they have now been dating almost 3 months. I am very happy for my friend, I haven't met her new bf yet but he seems to be very good for her, it's the first time since the breakup that I've seen her truly happy and smiling again and I thought at long last she was finally over Kyle.\n\nUntil 3 days ago. We were having a girls night, drinking wine, watching horrible chick flicks, playing Mario Kart and having lots of girl talk. And she mentions (after a couple glasses) how even though she is super happy with her new bf she just can't stop logging into Kyle's facebook account.\n\nI was like....????. What are you talking about? Kimberly says she still has Kyle's facebook password and she has been logging into his facebook (I can't remember if they blocked each other or just unfriended each other after the breakup) for a year sometimes to see what he's up to.\n\nI immediately told her what she's doing is super shady and creepy for one, and two is  kind of  disloyal to her current bf. \nKimberly got kind of defensive and said she didn't agree, that it's harmless and she just wanted to see what is going on with Kyle sometimes without having to talk to him directly. She also said that in the beginning she was logging in way too much (almost daily) but over time she has slowly scaled back and ever since she met her bf she only logs in a few times a month. \n\nI told her it's still wrong and she needs to stop it now. How would she feel if her bf was logging in to his ex's social media? How would she feel if Kyle was logging in to hers. She got flippant and said she wouldn't care and speaking of which, why did I care so much? Maybe I should mind my own business. \n\nNight was kind of ruined after that, and because Kimberly had been drinking I told her she could crash on my couch but I was going to bed. She left in the morning. \n\nSo here it is, three days later and I'm wondering what to do. I'm actually still friends with Kyle on Facebook. And I've been thinking of sending him a PM saying something about this. I haven't really figured out the right words though. On the other hand...I feel disloyal to Kimberly for going behind her back and talking to her ex and ratting her out. \n\nPlus I'm worried that Kyle will rat ME out to Kimberly and our friendship will be jeopardized. It's the last thing I want. Or that Kyle will be weirded out by me or not believe me. We haven't really talked since the breakup, just the occasional \"like\" on some of each others statuses and pics. I'm wondering if this is really even any of my business and if I should just stay out of it altogether and that I'm completely out of line to say anything. \n\n**","17":"I just want to say English isn't my first language so excuse any mistakes.\n\nSo my gf and I became a couple during college and we were a very happy couple all the 3 years we were together.We helped each other through so much and are much better people because of each other.\n\nRecently she took up a fellowship programme and met a guy there that she claims was just an infatuation. But it got to a point where I felt she was emotionally cheating on me. So when i confronted her about it, she said that she was suddenly freaked out about how serious we had gotten and that she wished she could have experiences with other men(we've both not been in relationships or even had flings before). I took it pretty badly but I managed to get myself together and accept the situation. She insisted we remained friends and even encouraged me to go to and \"try other women\".\n\nOver the next few weeks she would mention a couple of her experiences and then go on to tell me that she realised that I was right for her all along and she just did the whole thing because she suddenly felt claustrophobic in the relationship. \n\nShe now says she doesn't want to be with anyone else and wants to get back together. She's really nice to me and she seems genuinely sorry and willing to fix things.She says I'm even allowed a few flings to compensate for everything. Is this even right? Im confused.

When I told her I liked her about 2 weeks ago, I already knew she liked another guy but I was fine with it, since she was also interested in me. A week ago the guy starts liking her back (even though they can\u2019t speak, as he doesn\u2019t speak English and she doesn\u2019t speak his language) and starts getting all touchy-feely with her. I didn\u2019t expect this to bother me, but it did and after a couple of days I asked her to cut the crap and make a choice.

I apologized for asking her to stop doing things in the common areas, since it wasn't my right to ask her to stop (which she surprisingly said wasn't necessary. Apparently she'd been feeling really bad about doing it in front of me and would've been a lot angrier if our roles were reversed. She wanted to stop him but was really bad at saying no.) and we talked about a few other things. I told her it'd be best if we just gave each other some time without talking to really think about what we both think\/feel\/want and then talk about it.\n\nSecond EDIT: It's 5am so I'm going to bed and will try to reply to everyone in 5-6 hours when I wake up.

My mom is an insane, batshit crazy, raging bitch. And she hates my fiance.\n\nI have severe endometriosis and couldn't afford the surgery, and my parents offered to pay for it, which was amazing.  But a couple days before the surgery, I told her I would have my fiance take me, and she flipped the fuck out. She said since she's paying for it she needs to take me and take care of me, no one else is allowed to do that. If I refused and had my fiance take me, she would've called the office and ask them to refund her. She explicitly said so. I of course was shocked and agreed to having her take me. \n\nShe was delighted of course, and I was dreading it. \n\nThe day if the surgery comes and it's okay, but my mom was really upset that she couldn't find the charger to her camera. She wouldn't say what she needed the camera for, which was a bit odd. She also had a carry on suitcase with her I forgot to ask about. After the surgery she drops me off at home and leaves.\n\nI was relieved she left, but also confused because she wanted to take care of me?\n\nLater that night I was browsing Facebook and saw that right after dropping me off she went straight to the airport and took a vacation to California. She just up and left to go to San Francisco. What the fuck?\n\nSo thanks mom, thanks for forcing me to have you with me on the day I needed my fiance the most. And thank you for leaving without warning after you said you would take care of me. \n\nOkay, rant over.","21":"While being highly praised by many, the first games that came were generally a cluster of fucks, having awful battle sprites, an imbalanced battle system, awkward use of HM's Key items, and various gamebreaking and easily accessed glitches. The Pok\u00e9mon in this generation were okay, with only a few bland design choices (Mr. Mime, Muk, Jynx, Electrode etc.)\n\nGeneration 2 fixed these issues, had updated and cozy-colored graphics and added more content which fitted the Pok\u00e9mon vibe: A bug catching contest, simple breeding, a map twice the size the one in the games before, new evolution methods, Battle Tower etc. The only really bad part about these games were the Time Capsule (which was needed to obtain every Pok\u00e9mon) and the GS Stone; a Key item that only could be obtained through a specific internet event and was required to catch Celebi. The Pok\u00e9mon in these generation felt new and unique, but still felt very much in place with the earlier ones.\n\nGeneration 3 was okay. The graphics were allright in Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald, but looked weirldy compressed in FireRed and LeafGreen. The newly added Pok\u00e9mon were nice, but what bothers me about these games is the addition of Natures and the manipulation of EV's and IV's. While I think Abilities are a nice bonus to the Pok\u00e9mon, being able to change EV's and IV's ultimately ruins the feeling that Pok\u00e9mon is supposed to give you; that your Pok\u00e9mon is your partner. Because of this, it doesn't matter which Pok\u00e9mon you chose as your starter or which one is your favorite, since you will have to breed forth the strongest one for days if you want to use it competitively. This point is biggest reason I've started to lose hype about Pok\u00e9mon in general.\n\nGeneration 4, 5, and 6 were good, okay and less than impressive respectively. Gen 4 is my second favorite after 2 since I like the graphics, the music, the Pok\u00e9mon, the story and the postgame. Gen 5 had a generally bland design overall, as the words best used to describe the games is \"gray\" and \"dull\". Some of the Pok\u00e9mon were good, but many were forgettable. Lastly, Gen 6 had good graphics and good features such as liberated character mobility and character customization, but had too many bad Pok\u00e9mon designs, forgettable music, obvious plot twists and Mega Evolutions. Also, according to these three games, every legendary ever needs at least one alternate form.","22":"Obligatory this did not happen today. I have Protanopia, the color Red is non-existent to me, as well as most of the green spectrum, with a considerable part of the blue spectrum classified as \"Muddied\"\n\nback in 2006 I took a job outside of my chosen field, working in the transportation department, doing cargo shipping and receiving, I had been working on the software side of the industry and after being laid off, I called in a favor and started in the physical side of things.\n\nStarted out in an air cargo company, small outfit, less then 10 people, domestic and international cargo transport, I know the vernacular, I know how this works and I've got the talent to make things happen.\n\nI realize that I excel at the whole negotiation process in terms of cost for cargo and things are going smoothly,\n\nOne day, I'm tasked to do some work in the records room, sorting and filing waybills, I'm given the instructions,\n\n\"International shipments go into these folders\" Points to stack of boxes with open box of folders on the top \"Domestic shipments go into these folders Points to different stack\n\nPut waybills into folders, label with first name of supplier and store in drawer\n\nI bang it out, I'm on fire, I blitz through the back log and I get through 6 months of backlog in a day and a half.\n\nThe fuck up?\n\nFolders were red, and tan,\n\nI saw no difference, no one said any difference and the boxes under the open ones were mixed up,\n\ncue 4 months later, we are doing an audit and one of the files is noted to be in the wrong folder, then another, then another.\n\nThe company is in panic mode, because now their system cannot be trusted, so if they get an investigative hold, they might miss the paperwork etc etc.\n\nA memo comes out, and the whole company comes in over the weekend to basically re-sort the last 2 years worth of cargo waybills, we all sit down, grab boxes and start sorting, and that's when I realize that this is all my fault.\n\nSo I'm sitting there, holding up 2 folders, trying to tell them apart when the owner asks me \"What the F$#% are you doing?\"\n\nand I tell him that I'm color blind, that these look exactly the same, and that I'm pretty sure I screwed everyone's weekend up.\n\nI wish I could say a good laugh was had, but no, it was not, they were angry that I didn't bring it up before, It's not something that really effects life so I tend to not think about it, but in this case, yeah, totally my bad.\n\nProbably cost the company a good chunk of cash, everyone most of the weekend.\n\nWhen I was laid off a few months later, I really wasn't surprised.\n\n\n\n**EDIT** - As been stated, I was not fired for the mix up, the economy was tanking and the company went from moving 20+ shipments a day to maybe 3, the writing was on the wall.","23":"A month or so ago, my not-so-long-term girlfriend [19F] broke up with me [20M]. I shall call her Emma from here. We had been dating for about 2-3 months. We agreed to continue being friends since we shared friends before, and saw no reason to not continue doing the same after the breakup. I was a little down, but all in all in pretty good spirits. Emma had her close friend ask me if I was okay later in the week, which was nice, and I told her that I was fine and nobody need worry.\n\nWe all went to a party about a week or so after this, got fairly drunk, and I got together with a girl who we are both friends with [also 19F], who I shall call Olivia. I was very good friends with her before this. We continued to see each other in the next few weeks, leading to now. \n\nOlivia and I (perhaps a fuck up on my part) decided to keep it quiet amongst our friends, and tried not to tell anyone about our arrangement. We were not sure how long we would want to keep seeing each other and didn't want to 'rock the boat' in the friendship group, especially since Emma and I had just broken up.\n\nEmma finds out pretty quickly after her previously mentioned close friend somehow found out (not sure how) that we were making out at the party. She is quite distressed by this. I didn't find this out until she confronted me about all this recently.\n\nWe continue to see each other privately, and admittedly sneak off together after nights out (we are students). \n\nAll was well until I got horribly drunk last week. We all went to a bar, where I arrived late. I was sort of pleased to find out that Emma has found some guy to pair off with for the night, as this makes me feel a little more justified in seeing Olivia. A few of us went back to someone in the groups flat, it was a group of about 5 of my closer friends (including Olivia, not including Emma or her closer friends). I let it slip when I was blacked out that Olivia and I were seeing each other (as she told me the next day as she filled me in). I woke up very embarrassed and swearing off the drink as per usual. I had however allowed our arrangement to become *public knowledge*.\n\nEmma found out about this pretty quickly, and she later tells me she feels horrible. She says when she confronts me about it by text that I was wrong to hide it from her if I wanted to spare her feelings, made her \"feel like shit\", \"this has really changed my perception of you\". I keep my cool here and don't share with her my actual opinion on the topic of her involvement.\n\nNow I shall show my bias. In my opinion, she has nothing to do with this, it's not her problem, she isn't my problem. She broke up with me, I don't believe in a grace period between relationships, I don't think she had a 'right to know'. In my view, **I owe her nothing at all**. I hold these opinions regretfully, because before this I really rather liked her.\n\nSorry for rambling, so here's a **\n\nThank you, I will try to answer questions quickly.","24":"Alrighty guys, I've got an interesting one.\n\nSo to start off, I'm 17 years old and have only really dated a couple of people in my teen years. One of them was a girl, I'll call her Megan, who I 'dated' (if you can even really call it that) maybe 3 years ago. I don't remember the actual timeline, but that's a ballpark. Well, Megan and I only really dated for like four months on and off and nothing was ever serious at all, even for 14 year olds. We stopped talking for awhile after that because the whole thing was pretty stupid and rocky even for young teenagers, but eventually maybe a year later we reconnected somewhat and became sort of distant friends I guess? I don't really know how to describe it because we never really talked all that much except for seeing each other's posts on social media and checking in once and a while. We were amicable. I would see her post on her social media sometimes about missing an ex and how she had only dated two people, so based on process of elimination I knew there was about a 50\/50 chance it could be me, but since our 'relationship' was so flimsy and childish and not even really a real relationship at all, I thought it was someone else. Well, tonight kind of changed that.\n\nI hadn't really talked to Megan in about a month, and I think our last interaction was something about her telling me if I ever needed to talk or anything I could talk to her. She's a really nice girl and we are both going through a lot of problems with depression and anxiety and other things, so I pretty much have just thought we would continue speaking occasionally and being kind people. Distant friends. Tonight I was going through my normal night routine; watching Netflix and sitting in bed. I was actually FaceTiming one of my best friends Thomas (I'll use his real name, he's not really a part of the story) when I started getting Snapchat notifications that I was receiving videos from Megan. I got maybe 5 of the notifications, and I was confused but I thought it was either a long streaks video that sent in multiple segments or that Snapchat's notification system was broken. A few minutes later I got off the phone with my buddy and checked the videos, and they were videos of Megan, drunk and topless and telling me I 'am a great person' and I 'deserve better than her' and she started talking about how she regretted a lot of the things she had done to me when we were together. She was clearly drunk and topless, and she didn't flash me or anything, but I saw enough to know that there was definitely no clothes on the upper half of her body. I listened to the whole thing and at the end she said if she didn't remember this in the morning that I should remind her.\n\nI don't know why but the whole encounter has really weirded me out. I'm not attracted to this girl at all, and when I dated her I was just a desperate 14 year old who would date anyone who liked me. I also am currently in a relationship with someone and I do not in any way want to mess things up. I'm not too worried about that aspect though, I'm just generally kind of confused and weirded out by this. It was very odd and out of the blue and I have never really had anything like this happen to me yet. I do not like this girl back, and I honestly find it a bit strange that she is still hung up on me after three years going by since an awful childish middle school relationship. I haven't even seen the girl in person since we dated. The entire ordeal has just come off as very creepy.\n\nI am asking any of you older or more experience in situations like this for any advice on what I should do? I don't even know how to approach it. I'm extremely uncomfortable with the whole thing and just want to prevent it from happening again and let her know I'm not interested in that way, but I also don't want to be mean or upset her because she's genuinely a nice person. Thanks guys","25":"Backstory:  \n\nMy FH and I have been together for 7 years \\(it will be 8 two days after the wedding\\) and during the early stages of our being together \\(as teenagers in highschool\\) my dad cheated on my mom with FH's mom...

She said the people here were nice...\n\nAnyway...3 months ago I lost my husband. He died in a car accident when he was driving home from work. It was a rainy day, and the funeral was a week later. Around a week later, I came home from work to find my mother-in-law's car waiting outside my apartment. I had already talked to her at the funeral, and honestly our relationship was rocky already...I think she blamed me for being infertile. I walked up to the car, and at the same time, she got out. When I went to greet her, she slapped me. I was so confused...she scolded about me not calling her after the funeral, and asked me why I was not grieving and at work. I didn't tell her, but it was because the funeral was expensive and way out of our budget.\n\nAfter I got back up, she began to threaten to hit me again, and said what happened to what her son left her in his will. Which made me angry because he had not written his will. We didn't think we would need wills this early.\n\nWhen I told her that I wasn't going to give her anything, she slapped me again and started screaming how I was a whore and how I had meant to not have his kids...\n\nOver the next week she harassed me on the phone until I stopped picking up my phone. Around a week after I stopped picking up the phone, I came home to my mother-in-law in front of her car, and a moving truck parked outside my apartment. She again demanded that she was promised her share, and that she had come to claim it. I again told her no multiple times over the next hour, until at last the moving truck guys drove off. She said that I would regret this and left. I didn't think anything of it except her harassing me again on my phone, so I blocked her number.\n\nShe came to my workplace a week later. She verbally abused me in front of all my coworkers...talking about how I married her son for his money, about how I had killed him for his life insurance pay out. He didn't have life insurance...she came again the next day, and my coworkers didn't let her through the door. This has been going on for around a week, and it is making my life miserable...\n\nI don't want to get the police involved...\nWhat should I do?\n\n   \n**\n\n**EDIT**: I think I will call the police but I still don't think I can afford a lawyer...\n\n**EDIT 2**: I am going to the police station today. Thank you everyone for your advice! I have no idea what to do, whether to see if I can get a lawyer or just stick with a restraining order. I don't know what will happen at the police station either.\n\n**EDIT 3**: It's over. I talked to the police, and it took a couple hours to get statements from my coworkers, my boss, and they said it takes around a week to get a restraining order, but if she tries it again, they will arrest her...they haven't taken any immediate action, as they felt it would be a little too rushed, with few sources, all of which are bias to me (I agree) but they said if she does it again, \"she's gone.\" I guess going to the police was the best option. Thank you everyone!","27":"So to start out my husband's family has a weird dynamic. His mother never grew up enough to care for him properly so his grandparents (her mom and dad) stepped up. This makes it feel like I have two fucking terrible mother in laws! I am just thankful for my husband's grandfather because without that man to guide him through life he would be just as awful as these women. Anyway ...\n\nLast week we went to my husband's grandparents to help fix some issue they were having with their t.v. It was about 2 in the afternoon and we had taken my son to the park and walked around a bit that day before going over there. I should also mention I'm about a week away from 9 months with our second and my feet felt like they would Burst. When we arrive they were outside planting new bushes in their flower beds. My husband's grandfather takes us inside (while granny stays out planting) and we get everything squared away for them and leave shortly after. No big deal, just the usual \"hey guys, you're welcome, see you later\" dialogue. A few hours later my husband's mother texted him that \"her mother said I didn't like her\" and I guess I was rude. \ufffd\ufffd This is the only time in about 9 years that I have not sat and had a long (mostly one sided) conversation with this women, but whatever I chalked it up to she is old and that's just the way things use to be. \n\nFast forward to yesterday. My husband's uncle invites us over to his house for a Father's day cookout. We show up and my husband's grandfather asked him to drive him back to the store because he forgot something he was asked to bring. I stayed behind with our son and made sure to say hello and talk a bit with my grandmother in law so not to offended her again. All goes smooth. I even stared to have a really long in depth conversation with the uncle's wife who I have really only even talked to in passing at family events. It was nice and everyone was happy and having a good time. That was untill 2 hours after the party stared and my MIL showed up. She was upset because the food was cold\/almost gone, her uninvited guest was not really welcome, and to top it off my husband and I were getting ready to leave to go home and relax before work the next day. The last 30 minutes we were there she sat off in the corner texting on her phone not talking to anyone and at this point I was finishing up my earlier conversation with the uncle's wife. Well today my husband gets home from work and tells me he got another message about me from his mother...\ufffd\ufffd. This time she is offended that I was talking to the uncle's wife and not to her! \n\nIdk maybe this sounds super dumb to be mad about. It could also just be the cherry on top of the shit Sunday these women put me through, but I feel like I can't win no matter what I do. It's like sometimes they are trying to train me like a dog. Talk now, sit here, speak! Them texting my husband about my \"bad behavior\" is really just a rolled up newspaper to my back end. It does feel a little better getting this out there and good Lord knows I didn't intend on writing a freaking book, but here it is \ufffd\ufffd","28":"This was several years ago.  Relevantly, in the era before computers were very prominent, and few students had a PC. \n\nSo, I played music in college.  In fact, I started off going for my music degree, fine arts major (music performance) with a math minor.  But junior year, I broke my hand, and realized how fragile a musician's life could be, so I switched.  Didn't want a full math major.  So, that late, the only degree I could get in a reasonable time was a General Liberal Arts Bachelor.  Requirements:  a certain number of credits, a certain proportion of which had to be upper division, with a selection of classes in different fields.  I already had all the credits I needed in math and fine arts, so I figured I needed about two years, taking all the 300 and 400 level classes I could with no or minimal prerequisites.   I figured it out for myself, never consulted with an advisor or councilor.  Didn't have the ability to check graduation progress online, but who needs that, I can see the requirements myself in the student handbook.  This is my biggest fuck-up in the story, probably the biggest of my life.\n\nI had taken freshman history, so I was able to get into 300 and 400 history.  AP in high school got me the basics in English, so I took 300 and 400 level lit classes.  For science I took a semester of physics, and then was able to get into 300 and 400 level anthropology.  A couple of others - linguistics, sociology, econ. \n\n2.5 years later, I'm done.  I haven't quit playing music, I still enjoyed it for sports, and all my friends were in these groups,  plus there were paying gigs.  Like graduation.  I played in the graduation band ($50 or so, as I recall), wearing cap and gown, like seniors do.  It's a big school, they didn't call individual names at the mass graduation, just, \"grads from the school of engineering (or whatever) stand up!\"  And I, in general liberal arts, didn't really want to go to my college's private graduation later.\n\nSo, I figured I'd get my diploma later.  I never did, but I was working full time, getting married that summer, and I never noticed. \n\nI have a job that never required proof of graduation.  But then, they instituted a certification that did.  So, no problem, I called the U. and told them to send my transcript.  They said \"No problem, but do you realize you never graduated?\"\n\nI was beyond flummoxed.  What the hell, I knew I had all the credits I needed, what's wrong?\n\nMusic performance credits.  You take a band, orchestra, jazz band, chamber music class, usually 2 or 3 of those, every semester as a performance major.  Those are hard credits, usually only like one credit hour for three hours worth of work, not to mention practice.  They're demanding.  But for the General degree, they wouldn't count repetitions of the same classes toward the number of credits earned.  I was 9 credits short. \n\nI had written on my resume that I graduated.  For several years.  This was about 12 years after the fact before I found this out.  The U. never contacted me.  I couldn't believe it.  I needed this for my job now.  But I had no college degree.\n\nSo, I went back to school, knocked out 9 hours of night classes and distance learning in a semester.  Turns out, the University has a department made for helping \"dropouts\" get their degrees, so I even got a scholarship.  I took a GIS class, architecture, and City Planning.  Because why not?  They were fun, I learned a lot, and knocked them out in a few months.  But no one in my life will ever let me forget that I lied for several years and pretended I was a college graduate.","29":"My apartment consists of 4 tenants and 1 sublease. One of the tenants is my boyfriend and he lives in my room with me. The sublease is my friend and the other two girls are tenants with their own rooms. The two girls have made copies of their house keys and given them to people I do not know. These people have let themselves in without anyone's permission besides the people who gave them the key. My boyfriend has seen both of my roommates boyfriends come in on their own to do various \"chores\" while my roommates are away. They do not tell anyone they are coming in and do not lock the door when they leave. My roommates have not asked us to do these chores for them, instead they went straight to making copies of their keys and giving them to people *they* trust. \n\nToday I was playing Overwatch in the den and the doorbell rang. I heard the girl in the apartment upstairs talking to someone on the phone. She told whoever she was talking to that she knew my bf and I were at the house. I did not let her in because I was curious as to what she was doing. She then let herself in the previously locked door to my apartment. I asked her why she was here and she said she was getting something from my roommate's room. My roommate has a lock she installed on her door and apparently this girl has the spare to not only our apartment, but also my RM's door. I, obviously, do not. \n\nWhen she was done in there she came in the den and asked where the (MY) hdmi cable was. I told her I was using it. She told the person on the phone (my roommate, obviously). Before she left I asked her to give me back her spare key to the apartment. She did. \n\nI contacted my roommate and learned that this girl, their bfs, and her other friend all have copies of my apartment key. This is not ok. I told her it makes me uncomfortable to have people I don't know coming in and that it needs to stop. She hung up on me. \n\nWhat do I do to get the keys away from these people? They are apparently coming in and taking our things without me knowing and I am extremely uncomfortable knowing I have no say in who comes into my personal space. On top of that we live in a bad area and they are leaving doors unlocked. My bf and sublease are also uncomfortable with this but do not know what to say. My bf almost drew his gun on my RM's bf at 2am when he let himself in. This is clearly not ok but I don't know what to do to resolve this?","30":"This woman isn\u2019t even my MIL yet and she\u2019s already causing problems.\n\nMy boyfriend and I haven\u2019t been together too terribly long, but we already feel a very strong connection. I\u2019ve been deliriously happy with him up to this point. A family friend of his is getting married next weekend, and he told his mother back in June that he would be bringing someone. I asked for the weekend off of work and that was that. But apparently his mother RSVP\u2019d for him without telling him until today, and she only put him down for one. It\u2019s too late to change it now. I\u2019ve already heard enough warnings about his mother, including that she was part of the reason him and his last girlfriend broke up, but he desperately tried to reassure me that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Now, she\u2019s refusing to budge, and he\u2019s forced to go to this wedding. Since my schedule for work is already out, I\u2019m going to be alone the whole weekend with no one else to keep me company. My mental health is in rough shape right now, so I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be safe if I\u2019m alone. Boyfriend has told me that not going to the wedding will cause a major argument. He\u2019s not 100% financially independent yet, and he feels as though his mom would cut him off over this. His mom seems to really have her claws deep in him: she won\u2019t even let him change his permanent address to where he lives on his own, one state away from her.","31":"Context: So today I was helping at a Japanese-themed workshop, and I was leading the origami \"department.\" I had made some origami to showcase (from expensive imported Japanese origami paper) that took a lot of effort - I had to spend a rather large amount of time on it as I wanted it to be as close to perfect as possible. \n\nPlease note that the workshop was FREE, and we did provide paper - just not the most expensive stuff, and people could take what they made home. Again, for no cost at all.\n\n\u200b\n\nNow that you know what I was dealing with, here comes the actual conversation with the EP. \n\nEP: \\*comes to the origami table with her 8 to 10-year-old son, handles example of a rather complicated origami piece\\* Hello, is it possible to make this and take it home? I really like it.  \nMe: Sure! Are you or your son going to be making the piece? It's a rather time-consuming one, and it requires tremendous amounts of concentration and precision as every single mistake will offset it noticeably.  \nEP: My son, but don't worry! I'm absolutely sure he can do it.  \nMe: Alright. \\*shows her son how to do it\\* \n\nOver the course of making the origami, her son ruined multiple sheets of perfectly good paper, and the ones that he didn't ended up being horribly imprecise (it's a modular origami that requires 8 sheets). I tried to fix what he did, but to no avail. \n\nMe, to EP: I'm sorry, it's not possible to make this into the final product - it is so imprecise it's not even possible to assemble. (\"What did I tell you, woman?!\" I think to myself)\n\nEP: You should've told me my son wouldn't be able to make it!\n\nMe: I did, and you explicitly denied it! \n\nA heated argument breaks out - you can imagine how it goes.\n\nConversation continues after it:  \nEP: You know what? You should give us this one (pointing at the one made out of expensive paper I spent hours on)  \nMe: Sorry, that one is only for display purposes.\n\nEP: I don't care. You are wasting our time. I came here for my son to make some nice origami but you failed to deliver, so I want compensation.\n\nMe: Sorry to say this, but I believe that, as compensation, would be completely inadequate to the situation, even if your point was valid. \n\nAnother argument breaks out. \n\nShe didn't get the origami.","32":"Long-time lurker here. Before you ask, yes, I took several pregnancy tests and my birth control does not inhibit me from having a normal my menstrual cycle. I haven't embarked on any crazy diets or exercise schedules...\n\nI have a full-time job (40-60 hours\/week) as a staff member at a university in a very small college. Think one person, at best two, per professional field, no sense of teamwork whatsoever. I started about 7 months ago and I was under incredible stress (moving to a new house alone, starting a new job, etc.). At the beginning I loved it and it was a million times better than my previous position which was in a totally different field that became monotonous and the work environment was toxic. I felt a decent amount of respect at my new job, but I realized that my two bosses were forcing me to do projects outside of my contract agreement because I worked so diligently and always met deadlines whatever the cost. Yes, I had no one else to go to for help with these projects and I had no ability to hire another person.\n\nAbout 5 months ago, I stopped getting my period which was out-of-nowhere. I figured \"Hey, my coworker just quit, I'm taking over her responsibilities (basically another full-time position) and taking a higher level class. Management will just hire a decent replacement to take her place so I won't be as stressed.\" Dear readers, that clearly wasn't the case. Between the class, working both mine and my ex-coworker's jobs, undoing and redoing the mess my new coworker made, and doing half of another coworker's responsibilities.... it was a lot and I stupidly thought nothing of it because I wanted to keep the job. The pay isn't great, I just wanted to pay rent and have my semi-comfortable lifestyle. I had a coworker miscarry three times at another job and I thought \"pfft... that won't happen to me here\". To be safe, I took a pregnancy test, it came back negative, and I went on my merry way.  \nA second month passed and I still wasn't pregnant, but my stress kept inundating me. Another one passed, same story, but more responsibilities. At that time, I got scared because I've never gone more than two months without getting my period (except for the time when I was anorexic at 16 \\[which required hospitalization\\] and didn't get it for nearly 3 years, but that's another story entirely). Plus, given that history, I have to be extra cautious with that facet of my life. I told my two supervisors that this job and my multitude of responsibilities was unsustainable and I was being severely overworked, my coworkers saw the stress wear on me, and I wasn't being myself around my boyfriend (who I love more than anything in this world) or anyone who I truly cared about. Both supervisors told me that they'd work on it to decrease my stress and to have people help me out which made me feel a it reassured.  \nA few weeks after, nothing changed and it got worse. I had to pick up more slack and babysit more of my awful coworker and it then wore more at my mental health. After another big handful of weeks, it started to wear at my relationship with my boyfriend to the point where he had to tell me that I was losing who I am and that I was hurting him given the way I'd subconsciously lash out at him due to stress. I honestly couldn't tell that my words held that much weight and I vowed to resolve it because I truly love him.   \nSo that brings us to today... 5 months, no signs or symptoms of menstruation. It's been too long and my bosses' promises were not fulfilled, better yet processed in one ear and out the other. I told both of my bosses that I'm quitting. My female boss knows it's my elongated period of missed periods. My male boss knows that parts of my body are shutting down due to the stress. I plan on taking as much time off as possible after this week until the last day at my job in early June and I'm excited to correct the wrongness I did to my body and focus on getting a more stable, sane job. A few people have noted that I look less stressed already after giving my two week's notice without knowing what has gone on the past few months. I want to take the month of June to relax and reset my body because one shimmering bits of hope that drove me to get out of the psychiatric hospital where I rotted for 4 months was having healthy children. I want a family with the love of my life more than anything and I can't let any job ruin that for me nor should any job ruin that for anyone.","33":"My brother and his wife wanted to go out with some friends. I can't remember the exact details but my mom who was supposed to watch their kids but asked me to take the youngest, my nephew, to divide and conquer. He was the easiest baby so it wasn't an issue. Small side note, my nephew looks like a clone of me. We compared baby pictures and my SIL had trouble telling them apart alike. \n\nThat same day I had my nephew my SO and I had plans to go to a party at one of his Aunts. Aside from Wendy, FIL and Aunt no one else knew we were watching my nephew. There is family there that hasn't seen my SO in a long time which is one of the reasons SO wanted me to come. Wendy comes over super friendly, which was odd for her, grabs my nephew and starts showing him off. I didn't think anything of it at the time and assumed she loved babies. I'm a baby hog myself. I over hear laughs and things like \"look who Libida brought\", \"my baby\", \"SO is so good with him\" and other things about our \"little family.\" But she always giggles a bit after saying anything so I assume it's all a joke over a misunderstanding and she's explaining that we are baby sitting. If I'm going to be completely honest, I wasn't super focused on the comments or Wendy. They were serving damn good food and I love me a delicious potato salad and bratwurst.\n\nSeveral people come up and say how cute Nephew is. They said how we look so much alike. I say we do look a lot a like but my whole dads side look very similar so it's not surprising my nephew looked like me. There are a few puzzled looks and some say things to the effect of \"oh he's your nephew\" and \"I must have missed some thing.\" I don't think much of it because I assume they missed something too. Others ask how he got his name because it's not common. I say he is named after my brother who is named after my dad and so on. Again, puzzled looks and realizations are happening. Many people seemed to know he was my nephew though so again, I'm thinking some people are mistaken, mishearing or making assumptions. I mean, my SO and I haven't even been together long enough for me to have a baby, let alone one a few months old. Even if I conceived on our first date I'd still be pregnant.\n\nWhen we go to leave Wendy is holding nephew again (he'd been passed around a bit, all with my permission) and I when I ask for him back she clings jokingly \"don't take my baby!\" giggles and hands him over after giving him a big kiss. Again, it was totally out of character but at the time I really thought she just loved babies and Nephew was bringing out another side of her. I didn't realize it was the crazy side. I mean really, what person would try to pull off a stunt that makes her look like a grandma with someone else's kid? It sounds very circumstantial and if this were my only misunderstanding incident with her I would have brushed it off. But after years with this women I have realized \"misunderstandings\" is one of her methods to manipulate and get what she wants. I soon realized she was grandson crazy (granddaughters are nice but boys are where it's at) when I became pregnant soon after.","34":"Literally happened today. If I had hard alcohol on hand I would be drinking it right now and drunk-texting the shit out of my friends. I settle instead for a whopping 4.6% Tuborg Classic and Reddit.\n\nI'm an American living in Denmark. Moved here 2 years ago for an engineering job, ended up loving my job and haven't left. Bought an apartment. Learned Danish. The whole shebang. There's one fly in the ointment: no mountains here. And I can't afford a car to drive to Sweden on the weekends. I'm a sponsored mountain unicyclist (yes, that's a thing), so I just wanna go on adventures and train in the mountains but I can't do that with public transit. Long story short: I really want a car. But I can't afford one right now.\n\nBut hope...hope came to me today. I posted a picture on Instagram from the Red Bull Cliff-Diving finals on Saturday (they were cool), and I received a message request. From Red Bull Denmark.\n\n\"Congratulations!\" it said in Danish. \"It's a really beautiful picture. We've selected you as the winner of our contest!\" I was mildly stoked -- maybe I won sunglasses or something. But after messaging back and forth with the lady, I realized I didn't just win *some swag*.\n\nI had won an [Opel Grandland X](https:\/\/www.opel.dk\/biler\/grandland-x\/model-oversigt.html), a car that is fucking *designed* for adventures and awesome shit. Oh, and did I mention this car is valued at 280.000 dkk, which is about $43,000? I freaked out, had to leave my work meeting to calm myself down. In the last message from Red Bull Denmark, the lady asked (in Danish) \"Now I just need to check, you have a Danish driver's license, right?\"\n\nHere's the fuck-up.\n\nLast winter, I asked the Danish government to switch my driver's license from an American one to a Danish one. (Americans can do this.) What's supposed to happen is that they take 6 months to send my license to the Colorado DMV to check that it's valid (because apparently they can't just phone the DMV or access a database idk) and then I should have my new Danish license. Instead, what happened was that I received a few letters in Danish (which I didn't really understand) and my license back. I didn't think much of it. Fuck me.\n\nI have just re-read the letters. Turns out the Danish police thought my license was fake, so in the first letter they told *me* to authenticate it...somehow. Then, since I never did anything after the first letter (since, you know, I didn't understand Danish at the time) they cancelled my application. Moreover, the letter says I can now only get a Danish driver's through a driving course. WHICH COSTS ALMOST TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. Bitch, if I had $2,000 I would probably be at the Swedish MTB park multiple weekends a year instead of just two.\n\nAnyway, you might guess the rest of this story. As soon as I told the lady from Red Bull Denmark that I didn't have a Danish driver's license, she ghosted me. That beautiful, sexy adventure beast from Opel has probably already been offered to some other lucky Instagrammer. \n\nTime to drink. Cheers, Reddit.\n\n\n\n**EDIT 1**: *SHIT I'M A BIG FAT PHONY*. Everyone kept asking me if the contest was a scam, so I went back to re-read the messages (yes they came from a verified Instagram account) and it turns out...you win the car for *30 days*. I'm a fucking idiot. Take my karma away, reddit, obviously I don't deserve it.\n\nOther random info:\n* Getting a lot of skepticism about my finances. Fair enough. I like transparency and open communication. Here's a copy of a comment I made below:  I am working for a university as an engineer doing a research. I've also agreed to a special contract where I have some extra unpaid time off so I can go to unicycle events more. My post-tax take home is about $2,821 per month. I am paying friends back an extra $1,233 every month for helping me crowd-source the deposit on my apartment. Then, you know, food and bills and stuff.    \n* For the mountain unicycling: I would route you to my website for more pictures and videos, since this is my public reddit account. But I can't give personal info on this subreddit, so I sadly can't do that. Instead, here is the [Kris Holm factory team webpage](http:\/\/krisholm.com\/en\/team\/), where you can find a bunch of people to follow on Instagram and stuff. :)\n\n**EDIT 2**: Just FYI, I'm actually female. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_\/\u00af","35":"So, I'm in a bit of a quandary in my new(ish) relationship: \n\nI've been dating \"Casey\" for 5 months and we have a really, really great thing going. It's this really easy sort of relationship that isn't melodramatic. Instead, we communicate easily, truly enjoy each other's companionship and have a great intellectual connection &amp; sexual chemistry. \n\nCasey has an older sister who got divorced a few years back (how many years back.. I'm not totally sure, but definitely more than 5). From that relationship, there were two kids and one of them \"Samantha\" is 13. Sam spends a lot of time with her grandmother, her biological father and Casey. Samantha's mom (Casey's sister) is a really nice person, but very scattered and definitely struggles taking care of two children. She has them for alternating months, so 1-on and 1-off. Her bio-dad seems really \"with it\" and seems to co-parent well. Here's the problem: \n\nWhen Samantha is with her mom, she's despondent, sort of almost resigned to her fate. And... she says things, but not things like a melodramatic teen girl, but scary things. This past weekend I told her that Casey and I were going to be gone this weekend (her first weekend with her mother for the month-long stretch) and she said: \"Oh... **great**\" and followed-up with \"who'll feed me? Wouldn't it be cool if you could just go to sleep and wake up a month later? Or not at all? That'd be really cool.\" Thing is, she says things like this ALL THE TIME. Comments about how she wishes she could just cease to exist, how she wishes she could just disappear or blink and be somewhere else. She's very curious about death and once asked me about firearm-related deaths (I deal with criminal law cases). People will joke about her and her 'boyfriend' and how they'll have kids one day and she made a comment quietly, but loud enough that I could hear, that she'd never \"bring a life into such misery.\" \n\nI know that Sam's mom tries, but really struggles with being a parent. It's anathema to her personality and I think she had kids to try and salvage her marriage to her ex-husband. \n\nMaybe I'm crazy, but this sounds less like a cry for help and more of a full-on scream. \n\nI have an inability to be tender when being direct, I guess it's just my personality. I have a hard time sort of talking to an issue, I am very direct and get to the point. If I was to say anything, I'd need to say it to my GF and although we communicate really well, this is sort of above my pay grade. \n\nI'm appealing to the group here: How do I talk about this without ruining my relationship with Casey or damaging her her relationship with her family? How can I tactfully bring this up? What sort of strategies should I use? \n\n---","36":"Some family background: my mother grew up in a shitty town, and her family is (relatively) wealthy. My aunt never left, and deeply resents my mother for leaving with my dad, viewing it as 'abandoning' the family. She has a lot of kids, but the one in question, Scumbag, is her favorite. Scumbag is nineteen, doesn't have a job or go to school, and smokes weed in his mother's basement all day.\n\nMy partner is trans (FtM) and has been the victim of violence because of it before. We also now have a shiny and perfect baby girl. Needless to say, hormones have me in a state of hypervigilance, which may have aggravated the situation.\n\nMy aunt invited herself to visit my mother, bringing Scumbag with her. No one wanted to cater her needs, which is a whole other thing, so she got shunted into a shitty hotel. Shortly into their visit, when my family was asleep, I was woken up by someone breaking my door open. I immediately woke up my partner to call the police, and grabbed my baseball bat.\n\nScumbag was wearing a mask and had a knife, so I hit him with the bat to eliminate the threat to my family. I got in about two swings in before Scumbag started screaming about a \"joke\" and it was \"just him.\" The police arrived and arrested his dumb ass. I severely bruised his ribs.\n\nI'm going full steam ahead on the criminal charges. I do not buy Scumbag's joke defense in the slightest. My partner, who is already stressed because of the baby, is barely sleeping now, and the break-in has caused terrible memories to resurface. I replaced all the screen doors with metal storm doors, installed brand new locks and deadbolts, and put in a new security system, yet we suddenly don't feel safe in our home. He's looking at several very severe charges, and the cops apparently found cocaine in his car.\n\nMy aunt is losing her mind and is using every possible avenue to inform me I'm a terrible person for making sure her criminal son goes to jail. I've stopped answering the phone when my great-grandmother calls, because it's inevitably my aunt waiting to scream at me. She's hurled abuse at my mother because \"blood is thicker than water,\" as if my dumb cousin is more important than my child and soulmate. My good old boy uncles have opted to 'not take sides,' but are subtly indicating they'd like for me to make the whole thing go away.\n\nI'm honestly ready to go completely no contact with that half of the family, but my aunt is paying for my cousin's lawyer and is trying to butt into the proceedings. I'd also like both my mother and siblings to go no contact as well, and I'm trying to think of a way to word this that doesn't seem to pressuring. My siblings, I think, will be pretty gung-ho, but my mother still has a good relationship with my great-grandmother (though this incident is souring it.)\n\n\n\nEdit: Clarity!","37":"So this has all happened in a three-month span. A couple weeks after I moved into a new apartment, at around 2am I wake up to vigorous banging on my door, doorbell ringing and my letterbox clanking, a male voice yelling he wants to talk to me. Living alone and having had some psycho exes in the past, it literally scared the shit out of me. Not getting an answer, he swears and slips a note in. It\u2019s surprisingly polite, something along the lines \u201cPlease stop having such loud sex in the night; I gotta go work in the morning.\u201d  \n \n\nAt that instant it had been a week since the last time I had sex in my apartment, and I didn\u2019t remember being that loud then either.  Anyway, as the note seems quite well-mannered but the timing is really odd, I read he\u2019s mixing me with somebody else. So I head out to the apartment below, where I can hear him continue yelling at this point. Whatever, I need to fix this.  \n \n\nA very angry looking guy with VERY dilated pupils (meth I guess?) flings the door open and starts yelling as soon as I explain him the situation. Apparently the walls are thin and I haven\u2019t noticed that so my average-volumed sex life has been annoying him for a while now. Remaining calm, I apologize any inconvenience etc etc. He does not stop. \n\nHe starts to IMITATE ME HAVING SEX at 2am at our fucking stairway. I tell him I can see he\u2019s angry and I get that, and that now that I learned about the poor soundproofing I will be more silent.  \n \n\nNO. He is not going to stop. He proceeds to audibly MOAN and QUOTE THE THINGS HE\u2019S HEARD ME SAY, insulting me and my boyfriend for being \u201cfucking rabbits\u201d and so on. Needless to say, I\u2019m both furious and scared shitless although my past experience with violent and intoxicated people makes me swallow it. Using all the possible non-violent communication techniques I know, I finally manage to calm him down and even to the point we can shake hands in agreement.  \n \n\nI enjoy a couple moths of peace, no new encounters. On Monday it started again, this time it was about the sounds of me putting together a bookcase with a hammer. In the middle of the day. And it\u2019s the first time ever I have used hammer in the apartment, or any other kind of loud instrument for that matter. I admit it could\u2019ve been loud, but you know, I just needed to do it.  \n A day goes by. In the next evening, I can hear him hammering his ceiling. No problem, maybe he\u2019s just having a good old hammer time, inspired by my project. The sound becomes louder and I can feel it in my floor already. Okay wow, he really doesn\u2019t hold back. A pause, and then the pounding continues louder than ever, traveling around the floor.  It becomes clear that he\u2019s communicating with me.\n\n \\--\n\nIt makes me wonder if he\u2019s going to throw a tantrum again the next time I see him. While I\u2019m not afraid of yelling, I find it uncomfortable to pass his front door during nights since I have no idea how physical he could get. Making a complaint for my landlord (owns the whole house) feels uncomfortable also \u2013 you know, even if he got kicked out he might as well get back at me later.   \n \n\nAny advice? I\u2019d really love to keep my apartment since it\u2019s hard to find one where I live and everything else here is perfect. I need to figure some kind of master plan, I guess.\n\nSorry for the English btw. Not my native tongue.  \nCouldn't really decide whether the topic is considered relevant in this sub but I'll give it a try.","38":"Before we start I will say he was a German veteran of WWII, he was my grandfather but he in no way was a Nazi sympathizer. He was in the military before Hitler was in power and had no choice but to fight in the war.\n\nSo the story: When this happened I was really young like 6(?) So it's mostly from my mom and dad. So its basically like any other cast so the real only character I need to explain is J: J\u00fcrgen and GF: Grandfather P: Polizei\n\nSo we went to this festival in Germany for all the vets that served for the country. All the vets had a little reserved place for them and their family could go to while we stay in the field. It was going to be a nice play that was being played by some theatre kids(Like 18-21). So since my grandfather was a WWII vet he got a seat right up front. We had a number that matched a table. we were number 13 so we went to that table but hen we got there-there were already people there. It was a mother and her two kids. This is how it transpired\n\nMom: Excuse me, can you move. Our table is here\n\nShe looked at us like we're breaking into their house and stealing everything.\n\nEM: What do you mean? We were here first!\n\nMom: I know but my dad here\\*gesture towards my grandfather\\* is a WWII vet and they gave him th-\n\nEM: So he's a Nazi?\n\nthat really hit hard for my family as it is like the worst thing you could say to my grandfather as he already feels like shit for being in the war.\n\nEM: I'm not giving my seat for some Nazi! Leave!\n\nMy mom was super pissed! She started going off on this b\\*ch while my Grandfather and dad tried to calm her down while she was cussing and screaming at this lady. This called attention to my friend Dad's friend J\u00fcrgen who set up the whole thing.\n\nJ: Hey can you please quiet down so-\n\nEM: these people are trying to take our spot even though it's ours!\n\nJ: Uh mam, the seats are reserved for WWII vets.\n\nEM: So you're saying that since he's a nazi he gets the best spot! Apparently, nothing has changed from this country you racist sh\\*ts! I'm not moving for some Nazi piece of sh\\*t!\n\nEveryone around us finally looked at her and by now someone has called the Polizei and they came to see what was wrong\n\nP: What seems to be the problem ma'am\n\nEM: Theis sh\\*t heads are assaulting me!\n\nP2: Is this true \\*asking the tables around them\\*\n\nThey all said no and they arrested the mom for disrupting the peace. As they were taking here away she kept on saying vulgar stuff to my grandfather and my family as she was being taken away. They asked if we wanted to press charges but my grandfather said no(He was the kind of person that forgave everyone)\n\nWe later find out that she was American and her family was visiting a relative that moved from here. I know that Americans aren't all like that and I'm just sorry for her kids\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\nEdit: Fixed some stuff and thanks to all the people that are saying its not my fault. I really appreciate it. :)\n\nEdit 2: let me just say thank you for your words as they give me encouragement and it helps me remember to not feel terrible to be german. Sadly my grandfather died(of old age and it was a while ago) but i think he would have loved to see your comments\n\nEdit3: dont be obligated to apologize for america. i know a lot of great people from America and have been their myself, they are great people and i have no hate towards them. only that lady","39":"[Link to the original thread.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/4kird3\/i_27_f_want_to_propose_to_my_boyfriend_27_m_of\/)\n\nFirst off, my thanks to all those lovely people that replied to my original thread. \n\nI never expected so many comments for my fairly insignificant issue.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI went ahead and did it. Monday evening, it was just the two of us at my place, pretty much like any other night when he slept over. Except when I 'accidentally' had my phone slip from my hand and got off the couch to get it so that I could get on one knee and propose to Peter. \n\nHe was at a loss for words. Then he started laughing. Then he left the room for a second while I was looking confused, still on one knee and with the ring in my hand.  When he came back, he got down on the floor with me and asked me the same thing, with a ring in his hand! I don't doubt we looked very silly when we both started laughing. Then we tried to put the rings on each other's fingers at the same time, which led to some more silly shit, but all in all, it was great. \n\nApparently, he'd been carrying the ring with him for the past five months. He wanted to originally propose for New Years eve, but didn't manage to get the ring in time, so he waited for another shot at it. The rest of the evening went perfect! \n\nYeah, we had to throw out the food left on the table in the morning, but hey, the night before was totally worth it! \n\nI waited until Wednesday, so we could both get out the news to our families and friends that we were now officially engaged to be married, before I hit him up with my gift. We talked a lot on it, and eventually he asked me to for a few days to process it, as it was a fairly big deal to answer to in the moment. I made sure that he knew that I didn't give a damn about whether he got the degree or not, and if he wanted, I could give him a full language course as an alternative gift, or even for us to travel and stay abroad for several months so he could immerse himself in another language completely. \n\nWe were spending the night over at his place yesterday and he gave me his answer regarding the gift.\n\nWhile he was really, really appreciative to the lengths I'd go to help him fulfill one of his dreams from his youth, he said that ultimately it was just something of a passing fancy back then and even now, with all the expenses paid for, he didn't really want it or need it. One of the primary reasons why he didn't want to go and officially study at a university is that he thought that would probably prove taxing on our relationship and he didn't want that. Studying another language is all neat and good, but not at the expense of the life we've built together or the life we would have in the future. \n\nThe language course idea was also neat, he said, but in the end he thinks it would be more enjoyable for the both of us if we took that extended trip abroad. That said, I don't think we'll be doing all that much for learning the lagnuage. Mind you, won't bother me none :)   \n\nSo that's it then, folks. No 4 years of studying, no delays on the wedding. Come this winter, Peter will be my husband and I'll be his wife!\n\nGod, my head's still up in the clouds and there's a part of me that can't really believe this is happening. I've never been more happy! \n\nTo all the galls and fellas from the previous thread, again, my thanks! \n\n**","40":"hey everyone!\n\nSo a week ago I (M24) stopped talking and with four of my long time buddys (M23-25). We have known each other for around ten years now but I moved to a different country so we only keep in touch via gaming.\nIn the last few years we were gaming together almost every day and a bit of mocking here and there was pretty much normal but it suddenly got way worse towards me. \n\nI don't really have a lot of money and I don't earn anything because I'm taking care of my father who has cancer. When I finished school, I never looked for a job but helped in the house and  with my little sister. My father is much better now and I've been searching for work for a year now but it's really hard with such a big gap in the history. My Friends know this!\n\nBecause of that of course I'm not able to afford any new games or any new hardware which leaves me left out a lot. This wouldn't be a problem for me if my friends wouldn't constantly mock me because of it. It started off as a bit of fun but with the time it got a lot worse. Because I sometimes had lag or couldn't afford a newer game or pc they mocked me To a point where they refused to play any games with me and just started all rounds alone (with me listening to it in voice chat).. and they started insulting me calling me a poor shit and making jokes how i will soon sleep on the street and eat junk.. that wasn't even the worst thing they told me too.\nI told them to stop multiple times but they just called me a crybaby\n\nAfter that has been going on for a few months I decided to just delete them and never talk to them again. This was not an easy decision scince they were pretty much my closest friends  but I couldn't take it anymore. \n\nTwo of them have been messaging me on phone and asking what's wrong and if I wouldn't have money for the power bill or what.. I now blocked their numbers as well\n\nNow im kind of sitting here alone and have no one to play with and I'm asking myself if I overreacted and if im acting like an Asshole. Thoughts? \n\nI'm sorry for spelling mistakes English is not my main language \n\n\n\nMy friends constantly mocked and insulted me for not being able to afford new games or Hardware despesite knowing my situation -i deleted and blocked them. AITA?","41":"Original post: \nhttps:\/\/m.reddit.com\/r\/JUSTNOMIL\/comments\/58cvp5\/fmil_needs_our_room\/\n\nA couple days ago he finally got ahold of his mom and she said she was just as annoyed by this whole situation as we were. FFIL was trying to look out for her apparently and he was going crazy. She kept saying that this whole thing doesn't matter to her and that she doesn't want a week full of awkwardness over a bed. I mean part of me believes her but she had to have said something about the stairs to get him going. Idk it was weird but his dad was really the one making things ten times worse. She told us to tell him that she'll get our room just to make him be quiet. (I don't agree with this btw, he's a grown man and should know that things don't always go his way). I still don't trust her.\n\nLater that day my fiance said he wanted to call his grandma (his dad's mom) and get her opinion. (I wasn't a part of the convo just listening to it) He tells her everything I wrote in the last post and that his mom doesn't care about which bed she gets. She somewhat agrees with us but goes on this tangent about how I need to be respectful to his mom and when his mom comes she is queen of the house. If I can't grow up and be nice then I should go live at my parents house for the week. We aren't married so I'm not as important as anyone in his family. I'm just his fiance. Needless to say I got upset, lots of crying. At one point in the convo I told him to stick up for himself. As soon as he did that his grandma said that what he was saying sounded like it was coming from me and not him. That honestly made me sad. She was basically saying that he never sticks up for himself so when he does it certainly couldn't be coming from him. This family seems to be okay with people acting out and it's okay as long as they're an elder. I give everyone respect and it was insulting that she would think i was going to be rude to his mom. I wouldn't have bought her a fucking Roku if I was being mean. I am respectful but if you don't deserve to have respect I can certainly say something about it. I really love his grandma, she had been the most accepting of me but this just killed my vibe for her. She also kept saying that he owes his mother so much for everything she's done for him. Last time I checked a child shouldn't be burdened like that. She makes it seem like everything he does in his life need to be for his mom. Screw that. He didn't choose to be born and definitely not to these people. I feel like his family is toxic but maybe that's just because I'm in so deep in this.\n\nThroughout this I've talked to my parents and sister. They have been amazing. My mom talked to my grandparents about it and they are on my side 100%. My grandma got mad and I have never once seen her get even a little irritated. So that felt really nice to have support. My parents took my fiance and I to lunch yesterday. They gave us a lot of good advice and made us see things from both sides but they agree with us that we were handling it very well. My dad kept telling us that we needed to start setting boundaries and soon. That's what he did with his mom. Telling her not to make him choose because he would choose my mom. I'm so thankful for them, they are truly the kindest people ever. My mom kept offering to buy anything else that we might need for her even though we all know she doesn't deserve it. \n\nI am so glad I have a fiance who has been choosing me over this craziness. He has been comforting me when I'm sad and has been angry when I've been angry. I am almost a little glad this happened because it showed that we could get through this weird craziness without turning on each other.\n\nAlso his dad wants us to get a prenup. Fuck him. We have talked about it before, not that it would really be filled with anything. If my fiance wanted it I would get it. He's been burned before and only wants to protect what he had prior. What we've built together is ours. Anyway I am offended that his dad said that. He shouldn't question my character, I should really be questioning his. If we get one it it will never be any of his business!\n\nThanks again for being there for me you guys! It has been so helpful. You guys have given me confidence and have made me laugh through this shitty time.","42":"Hi everyone, I am a mom to one son and I have a very tricky and sad problem on my hands.\n\nMy son left his iPad at my house the other day and because my we both have the same model, I had to click around to make sure it was his and not mine.\n\nThe first thing that popped up was a website that he apparently had joined to try to restore his foreskin.\n\nNormally I would have just said oh okay well it\u2019s not mine so let me turn it off.\n\nWell - I made a decision when he was born to have him circumcised (his father was absent) myself.\n\nSo my heart sank when I read his forum posts about how he resents me for doing this to him but that he will never be able to tell me because it will break my heart. So he pretends to love me to avoid conflict but as a result he bottled up his anger inside.\n\nI had no idea that men in generally can get upset about this kind of thing but once I started reading the arguments against it then I started feeling sick to my stomach.\n\nI had my baby boy circumcised without his consent and as a result his body is different now than how he was born.\n\nI am mad at myself for doing this and now I understand that this is all my fault.\n\nHow do I talk to my son about this?\n\nHas anyone ever had regrets of having your boys circumcised or are you a man that has had it done and hates it?\n\nI can\u2019t live with my son secretly hating me inside because of a selfish decision that I made for him because I was too lazy to want to just clean his penis properly as a child.","43":"Obligatory this didn't happen today, but about 6 months ago. I was doing some grocery shopping and a bag of Wonderful pistachios caught my eye. I love me some pistachios so in the cart they went. Later that night I'm sitting on the couch watching TV in the dark when I get a hankering for some hard work followed by salty nuts in my mouth. Good thing I had just purchased the perfect snack for that. I grab the bag and get crackin'. After a few I get a weird one, it was a little bit soft and had an off putting taste. Sometimes they get burned or whatever and don't taste right so I thought nothing of it and kept chomping down. I got a few more bad nuts and thought to myself, damn Wonderful is off their game they burned all of these 'stachios. Then I bite into one and its also soft, but this one had a really weird \"hairy\" texture and an awful taste. I spit it out and finally decided to turn on the lights. I examined the remnants of my spit out snack and I see what looks like a spider's nest inside the pistachio. I break it apart further and to my surprise(or non-surprise at this point) a small worm looking thing that had been living in there, baked to a crisp. I started opening more nuts and examining them in the light. About half had these dirty little fuckers embedded in them. By my estimation I had eaten approximately a handful of baked zerglings thinking they were just burned pistachios. After much vomiting, I did some research and apparently they were likely navel orange worms, a field pest that infest pistachios. I was thoroughly grossed out and still cannot eat pistachios, but at least it seems that eating them isn't harmful.  \n  \n[This isn't my picture, but it looked very similar to this](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/hkvbv1462ery.jpg)","44":"So I'm in my English class and we're discussing contemporary hip-hop. The issue at hand was Rick Ross' 2013 scandal in his song U.O.E.N.O. The lyric in question was:\n\n&gt;Put Molly all in her champagne, she ain't even know it  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain't even know it\n\nI laughed, and the immediate reaction from my class was that it was inappropriate and that I was finding humor at the expense of encouraging date rape culture. I didn't even attempt to explain myself because I've learned over the years that when you're in a hole, stop digging.\n\nAllow me to explain myself here. I sometimes forget people aren't in my head. I wasn't laughing because the lyric was inherently funny. I was laughing because the lyric was so fucked up, it was ridiculous to me that an \"artist\" from a major record label would ever get that lyric to post-production. Like I'm assuming there was a listening party before launch. There's probably a sound engineer. There's probably a board or committee who sees projects through from start to finish. The idea that this shitty lyric made it through every quality control checkpoint was just hilarious to me.\n\nIn my head, I was imagining Rick Ross sitting at a desk with a pen and paper, scribbling \"Put Molly all in her champagne, she ain't even know it, I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain't even know it,\" and thought, \"Man, this is a good idea.\"\n\n**","45":"So a little background first...\n\nMy MIL turns her nose up at drinking. As far as I know, her reasons for this involve strong traditional Christian values, growing up without alcohol, and viewing it as a irresponsible, dangerous, unhealthy habit. 2\/3 of these reasons are hypocritical because Jesus drank wine and she engages in other unhealthy habits (mostly related to her diet). I don\u2019t think she grasps the concept that people can drink responsibly and not everyone who drinks is a raging alcoholic. For example, she had serious concerns that I was still drinking when I was pregnant. Anyone who knows anything about me knows I\u2019m a social drinker and I cut that out of my life immediately and easily just like most educated, moral 20-something women. \n\nIt\u2019s always disappointed her that my husband and I are social drinkers and we don\u2019t always go to church on Sundays. Our lifestyle is different than hers and it displeases her.  In the past she has actually berated me like I was her teenage daughter in regards to us responsibly drinking on a weekend get a way with the family. She actually said to my face \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be drinking if it\u2019s possible you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d Not that it was even any of her business, but we were using multiple forms of birth control at the time so again, we were drinking RESPONSIBLY. She also pressures us into going to church regularly even though we are grown adults who chose to be involved in our faith in other ways. Both of her sons will be the first to agree that she is very opinionated and closed-minded. \n\nI dread going to visit my husband\u2019s family 2.5 hours away because I feel so awkward spending a weekend in their small, musty, dirty farmhouse house in the middle of nowhere. They are very dry, traditional, simple people. Time just drags on for me while I am there.\n\nI\u2019m not clear on my MIL\u2019s house rules for alcohol. There was one time that my MIL\u2019s out of town sister brought wine to a holiday being hosted at my MIL\u2019s and wasn\u2019t an issue at all. My MIL even tried some and laughed about it, saying \u201coh my, my joints feel...kinda loose now...he he\u201d while weirdly repetitively shrugging her shoulders.\n\nSome more background...\nI work 2 jobs, my husband and I have house projects, we\u2019re raising our first child. It\u2019s few and far between that we get a weekend to have time off work, spend time with family, get help with our little one, and get to relax. \n\nI\u2019m bringing a potluck item to a family picnic at my MIL\u2019s and would like to also bring a bottle of wine or some small alcoholic beverage(s) to enjoy a couple drinks. \n\n\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t about just one weekend. If it was, I\u2019d just not bring my beverage of choice to make things easy. However, this is about every future family function\/ holiday at my in laws for the next many years to come in which I am using my precious weekends off every now and then to travel and visit them. \n\nDisguising my drink isn\u2019t something I\u2019ll do because as a 28 year old that just feels so ridiculous and the drinks aren\u2019t worth even a small amount of effort to do the disguising","46":"A couple months ago, in the early part of the year, my husband and I bought a lovely older home. It was affordable, needed a bit of work, but nothing too difficult. I'm the primary breadwinner though we both worked.\n\nLast month, my husband quit his job because it was too stressful and we agreed that he could stay home for a bit and work on the house over the summer while applying for new jobs and finding a better fit for him. He was coming home angry and irritable every day and we calculated that my salary is enough to keep us afloat for a little while without depleting our already exhausted savings (see: bought a house earlier this year). I figured, sure, his emotional well being was worth more than having money to buy everything or hire contractors. We can delay some of the fixes on the house or DIY. But some stuff was in progress and has to be completed.\n\nOn to the actual problem. It seems like every time my husband gives me a \"task\" to do related to planning around the house renovations I fuck it up. I try to carefully check my work. I try to plan ahead and foresee any major issues. But I just can't seem to get it right. I'm costing us extra money. I'm delaying all the work because I've miscalculated the volume of whatever we needed today. \n\nI. Fuck. It. Up.\n\nEvery time.\n\nAt least it feels like it. (I'm certain I'm not, but my depression is making it incredibly difficult to come up with examples where I've done okay at anything.)\n\nMy husband has gotten increasingly angry at me for these mistakes and I keep telling him that he needs to either help me check the numbers or just do it himself but he insists that I need to \"learn\". All that keeps happening is that I now have no confidence in making good choices anymore and get anxious and afraid about even expressing an opinion because I don't trust my judgement at all.\n\nSome of it is unreasonable, some isn't. I picked an exterior painting company (with his input) and they've delayed on us because of bad weather. This isn't my fault, I don't deserve to be snapped at about it. But I also calculated how much soil we'd need to fill some holes in the front lawn and put in the wrong numbers, ordering far less than we'd need. Totally my fault.\n\nAnd now I don't want to go home because I know he's going to yell at me again because I made another mistake and while I know it's just that he's frustrated, I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nHow do I fix this? How do I stop making this rookie mistakes?","47":"A little backstory, I\u2019m 20f, my sister is 29f and a single mother of two non-verbal severely autistic children, a level of severity in which it\u2019s doubtful they\u2019ll ever even have limited functioning in society even with full time therapy. She divorced their father about 5-6 years ago and the children are now 9 and 10. Their disability is intensely severe and I work full time as a caretaker to assist in their upbringing and daily needs. I have stated multiple times that I don\u2019t want children now, and don\u2019t know if I ever will, partly because I\u2019ve seen how severe some disabilities can be and don\u2019t think I would be mentally or emotionally capable of handling the worst case scenario. \n\nMy sister loves playing the \u2018what if\u2019 game and today she\u2019s been asking me if I love my niece and nephew and trying to figure out how I can say I love them if I\u2019m not willing to care for them in the case of her death, and kind of insinuating that I\u2019m an asshole for not being willing to do so. I do love them but I\u2019m mentally exhausted each and every day I leave work just after a few hours of being around them and their extremely demanding needs. Being in a caretaker position has brought about extreme increases to my anxiety and depression that I\u2019ve struggled with for years. \n\nIn the case of my sisters death I feel that I have no right legally or otherwise to take care of her children when her ex-husband has a good paying military job and a wife that stays home everyday raising his other two kids. Legally the children would go to him as his responsibility, not me, a struggling college student living at home with my parents. \n\n\n\n*Adding an edit- some of you have expressed your concern for my mental health in a job I dislike, thank you for that! I do want to ease concerns by explaining that I\u2019ll be leaving the job and finding a new one in a different field this fall once I complete my bachelors degree. I took this as a temporary position for the 2 or so years I needed to finish the degree as it pays higher than most jobs I could find. My sister knows of my intentions and gives me mental health days when I ask, so it\u2019s mainly just the status of \u2018aunt\u2019 that has given her preconceived notions and hope that I\u2019d step up for the children despite what I\u2019ve told her in the past.","48":"I typed out the full backstory to my post in JustNoFamily. \n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JUSTNOFAMILY\/comments\/alaasy\/is\\_my\\_mil\\_a\\_justnopart\\_one\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JUSTNOFAMILY\/comments\/alaasy\/is_my_mil_a_justnopart_one\/)\n\nOther things that my DH complained to his mother about in this time included my spending habits. Keep in mind that during this point in our marriage, we fought about how I was wasting money by buying staplers, because when are we ever going to staple anything? We don't need printer paper, we can steal it from his work-etc. To be fair, I also bought plenty of art supplies, because this had become my outlet and my therapy. DH did encourage the making of the art itself, and my volunteering. This becomes important. \n\nMy MIL is still pleasant to me when I see her, which is not often as she lives in another state, and I hope that she sees how unreasonable DH is when he complains to her at least once a week. DH is at this point going through depression and we act in concert to try and encourage him. She comes to visit and it's fun. However, she keeps asking me why I can't get a job. Why can't I work from home? I wasn't functional enough to work from home at this point, or go back to school, and school had been tainted horribly because of the trauma associated from having to leave due to my disability. I kept trying to explain this to her, but she persisted, dismissing my trauma and using the \"plenty of people do it\" argument. If I could volunteer, I could work, right? It felt like talking to someone who was over-privileged and a bit clueless, besides hurting.\n\nThen my MIL comes to visit our new condo. I was very much looking forward to sharing our new home with her, as her previous visits had been pleasant, and I was honestly proud of how it looked. But she was filled with disapproval from the minute she walked in. Where was DH's influence? she announced, in the home full of furniture we made mutually decided on and he had arranged. We had mutually decided to turn the dining room into a study\/library, because we always ate on the couch and didn't really entertain. DH was the only one leaving the house regularly at this point, and he wasn't very social with his colleagues. My parents had actually tried get us a dining room, and we had turned it down. But the minute she started asking where the dining room table was, so we could entertain, he started nodding his head, and throwing me under the bus. She disapproved of the partition in our enormous living room where my art supplies were. She disapproved of the fact that we usually slept on the futon in the living room which also served as a couch because it was better for my back. And there was my husband, nodding along with her suggestions, and then implying I had made those decisions-when we had made them together. Though things are very different now, I still feel hurt and betrayed by both parties for what happened. I felt betrayed by my husband's either lack of communication or need to agree with his mom, and by her for dismissing the home we spent most of our time in and any non-traditional manner we arranged our home. By her implication that I was supressing her poor baaaaby. \n\nBut maybe DH's complaining at the time caused this. Maybe I should let this go. He's genuinely changed(I'll go over this later)-maybe I should give her the benefit of the doubt. But how quickly he flipped on me-why did he have buttons like that installed? \n\nIt's not the last thing she's done that's made me suspicious. Stay tuned for part 2. \n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","49":"Background: This friend is my fiance's childhood friend. I have known this man for 8 years, and he is in a relationship with my friend...as a group, we consider each other as \"family\". Due to my busy schedule I have not seen this group of friends in about year. This occurred at a small birthday party for a mutual friend with about 10 people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone had a few drinks or shots at this party, and later in the evening everyone broke up into pairs or trios just hanging out. I was in the living room, singing karaoke by myself. He comes into the room and we start having a conversation and somehow get to the topic of my weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriend: \"You look different\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, I know I have gained some weight since the last time I saw you guys\"\n\nFriend: \"Oh well it's good weight, you are more....curvy\" (He's sitting really close, btw)\n\nMe: \"heh heh \\*chuckles awkwardly\\*, no no it's just the outfit\" (I move over to the other sofa)\n\nFriend: \"No, I don't think so.\" short pause... \"I think you would look like that naked too\"\n\nMe: ............\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get quiet after that comment and start singing again to escape the situation. I don't know how to process that comment. In the 8 years that I have known him he's never made a comment like that before or made me feel uncomfortable at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe comment stuck in my head the next day, and it's been a week since that happened. I want to brush this off and just forget about it, but I really don't know why this comment is stuck in my head. I've also asked myself once or twice if I should mention this comment to my fiance and my friend or if I should just brush it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. I felt uncomfortable with the comment, but is this a big deal?\n2. Do I tell my fiance or friend (the guy's girlfriend) about this comment? (He didn't make a move on me or anything, I just found this comment...strange).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\nFriend made a comment about my body, when I attributed it to my outfit, he said that \"I think you would look like that naked too\".","50":"Nora [25F] and I [26M] have been in a relationship for close to 4 years at this point, and our relationship has been great, but that is not the focus of this post. Nora has known her friend Helen [24F] for about 5 years, but they weren't particularly close until about 2 years ago when they reconnected. I became acquaintances with Helen shortly after I started dating Nora, and got to know her a bit better after Nora and Helen reconnected. All of us have a mutual friend named Eve [25F], who is particularly close to Nora and I (easily one of our closest friends). \n\nSeveral months ago, Helen started dating someone she met through a dating app named Nick [25? M]. All of our mutual friends, especially Eve, made an effort to be open minded to Nick but after meeting him, pretty much everyone came to the conclusion that he is a very unpleasant person to be around. Without going into too much detail, he has no social grace at all, has yelled at wait staff before, is openly bigoted towards certain groups, and lacks a sense of personal boundaries. It got to the point that several people, including Eve, approached Helen with their concerns quasi-intervention style. At first Helen seemed like she would take these concerns to heart but eventually decided to stay with Nick, even when several of her friends made it clear that their friendships with Helen would be strained or minimal if she continued to date Nick. \n\nThis came to a head about a week after the initial \"intervention\", when Helen spoke in a group setting with the friends that raised concerns about Nick, in order to give her perspective and let people know her decision to stay with Nick. Helen got very personal in what she said to Eve specifically by attacking her insecurities and bringing up Eve's history of mental illness and using it against her. While we were not present for these meetings, we heard about them in detail independently from trusted parties that were present, and both Nora and I are really disgusted with Helen's behavior. Nora in particular has told me that she doesn't think she would be able to get over Helen attacking someone's mental history. \n\nNow to the more immediate problem. Nora and I are engaged, with our wedding date set for later in the year. While formal invitations have yet to be sent out, we have sent out save-the-dates to both Helen and Eve. While Helen has approached us to let us know that she was cooling a bit on her friendship with Eve, Helen seems to think that we are not aware of what has transpired since we were not present. At this point in time, both Nora and I are uncomfortable with the prospect of having Helen at our wedding, or even staying friends with her, for multiple reasons. To complicate matters, she was previously moderately involved with wedding planning (she went wedding dress shopping with Nora), and has expressed a lot of excitement and interest in further involvement with the wedding planning. While we have already decided that we will be approaching Helen to uninvite her, we're not quite sure what's the best way to approach such a touchy and potentially volatile situation. We figured that it should probably be in private and not at our home, but aside from that, what is the best way to proceed with the disinvitation? \n\n  ---   \n  **","51":"So like the title says, our family was gathered around the dining room table enjoying each other\u2019s company and talking about the upcoming holidays. \n\nSomeone brought up Halloween and our Tim Burton style decor that we have slowly evolved into. \n\nThis reminded me of these two cartoony decorations we would put up as kids for Halloween a ghost smiling and a couple friendly jack o lanterns.

Well, I guess it depends on what it is three of.  So break out the popcorn ladies and gentleman we are about to begin our cinematic excursion.  The next three installments will solidify the fact that I indeed have the most horrific wedding story. Okay maybe not the worst there was no chair throwing or naked coupling but it was damn close to being that bad. \n\nSatan has thus far had an opinion on everything.  However, criticism is the only thing she has contributed to this wedding.  At least until this point. As we begin seeking our wedding party she demands that we use our nephew as the ring bearer.  He is two and cute so we agree. Well, naturally we should use her friend's granddaughter as flower girl too, and the flowers?  Well, a lady at her church does flowers so naturally she already asked her and she has come up with some beautiful arrangements using calla lilies.  \n\nFirst of all I hate calla lilies I think they look like dicks. Second, she chose colors that clashed with my entire wedding. My colors were navy blue and silver and she chose red and gold because those were her wedding colors and they had been so pretty.  Also, she has quoted a price WAY out of the budget. So I contact her and she says that Satan has already signed a contract on our behalf.  Wtf?  So she agrees to change everything and discount if I buy the flowers since I can get them at a discount rate at my job. I personally love carnations so I order them to be dyed in my colors.  Crisis averted right? Oh seriously?  No. Satan flips out. How dare I not accept her help? She was doing me a favor and I was so rude. \n\nThis is when we begin having nightmares with the dresses.  First my dress which had been ordered a year in advance because it had to be hand beaded is still not in. My mother bought my dress as our wedding present.  I did not personally love it but I did not hate it and because I was not the one paying for it I wasn't complaining.  The bridesmaid dresses are a whole crazy issue. I had five bridesmaids. The first ordered her dress the same day as me.  However, six months later it was discontinued. Therefore the other girls had to find something else. Then they discovered after the first girl ordered hers that it wasn't available in all sizes.  I ended up telling them as long as it was floor length and navy blue I didn't care.  Of course Satan says we should go with short red dresses instead. I respond that if that I don't want them looking like working girls. \n\nThen comes the bridal shower.  Once again Satan is pissed the invitation does not name her. She calls the day of and says she is running late. She arrived an hour late and gave me a diet book so I would look good in my dress because you know white makes you look bigger. And she reminds me that only virgins should wear white.  \n\nNext installment Disaster and diversion","54":"Obligatory this didn't happen today. It happened in January.\n\nI drive a used 2003 Honda that has never had a working CD player. Coincidentally, my car's original radio broke so when I replaced it with another radio\/CD player a year ago, the first thing I did was see if it played CDs. It did and I left it at that.\n\nFast-forward to one month ago and I'm taking a road trip with a good buddy of mine. I was excited about my working CD player and I remembered his extensive CD collection so I told him to bring it along. He was skeptical but I reassured him that this was a different radio\/CD player, that it would work because I tested it, and that his CD wouldn't get stuck. Well, his CD got stuck. The CD player made a whirring noise, showed a red light I had never seen before, and displayed \"CD ERR\" prominently which is also something I had never seen before. Because of me, I had lost his beloved Star Wars soundtrack and being the terrible friend I am I quipped, \"Welp, that's a new take on the Last Jedi\".\n\nTo his credit, he was a great sport about it. We considered his CD lost, my CD player inoperable, and we played the Hamilton soundtrack off his phone (he's a big soundtrack guy, if you haven't noticed).\n\nNormally, this is where a TIFU ends but mama didn't raise no quitters. I still had the car's original radio\/CD player in my closet so I took it out, took it apart, and figured out how to get the stuck CDs out without breaking my electronics. I then removed my car's new radio\/CD player, did the same, and got the CD out. Three and a half hours later, I was happily texting my friend a picture of the CD captioned with \"Return of the Jedi\". I returned it the day before Valentine's and a truer love story hasn't been told since.\n\nEdit 1: The CD works! There's a bit of stuttering on track 20 but he says that might've been there before it got to me.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/faHLPoK","55":"Throwaway for obvious reasons, but I'm not sure if bf is in reddit or not.\n\nI've been dating my boyfriend for 2 years and some change. He is a total sweetheart and he'd move mountains for me. I do truly care about him and know he loves me. We have plans to move in together soon, but I'm struggling with how I feel right now.\n\nWhen I say he's too nice, I mean he compliments me all the time. That sounds so awful writing out, but nothing feels \"special\" anymore. It's almost like it's a habit for him or he's going through the movements. Honestly, it makes me believe the compliments a lot less. He also is CONSTANTLY touching me, hugging me, grabbing, or kissing me. Now some people love that, but I can't stand it. I'm not a very touchy person and honestly it makes me not want to be around him. When I tell him I don't want to be touched he gets depressed and pouty and complains I'm not attracted to him or love him. When he gets into these moods I feel forced into comforting him or holding him even if I wanted space in the first place.  He also needs constant reaffirmation of our love, and asks me about 20 times a day if I love him, if I want to be with him, if he's the only one, if I'm sure we want to be together, etc. That's just exhausting for me, and it's now annoying when he asks, but even though I've talked to him about it, he won't stop.\n\nHe also always wants to spend time with me. Which is nice in itself but we hang out so much honestly I don't feel like we have as much fun anymore. I sometimes want to hang out with friends alone, which he is cool with if it's all women, but he constantly texts me and if I don't respond he may text me a couple more times. If I hang out with a mixed group(guys and gals) he gets upset he's not invited because it's no longer just a \"girls night\", but sometimes I still wanna hang out with MY friends alone since I see my bf daily. He used to have a lot of jealousy issues, and he has been working on them, but I'm pretty sure that's why he always want to be invited when guys are around. \n\nHe truly does so much for me, but it comes off as needy\/clingy\/smothering a lot. I don't even know how to bring this up, like, I don't like it when you're as loving as you are? When I talk about these things, he gets mopey about it and that's a turn off too. I would love advice on how to handle this. \n\n**","56":"So this actually happened yesterday. I\u2019m feeling all sorts of different feelings right now. \nI have google authenticator installed on my phone. For those who don\u2019t know, google authenticator is an app that's connected to your smartphone and make logging in more secure because you have to type in the exact code that\u2019s sent to your phone. When signing up for google authenticator you also get a backup code in case you lose your phone or get a new phone and want to continue using the same Google Authenticator account. My lifestyle is very connected with my online content so I connected lots of apps to my google Authenticator or to my phone number to authenticate.\nMy first fuck up is when I saved my back up code as a screenshot in my phone\u2019s files. I really didn\u2019t it was a big deal because I never lose my phone and I always had access to it. I also connected a lot of accounts to Google Authenticator such as my email, my YouTube account and my binance cryptocurrency wallet.  \nYesterday I was at the bus stop heading to get some lunch. I was using my phone and an older lady with wrinkled shaky hands asked to borrow my phone so she can call her grand kids. I was relatively fit, I\u2019m young, I\u2019m athletic so I was pretty confident this lady can\u2019t outrun me if she decided to run with my phone. I asked her for the number she was calling, I type it in and handed my phone over to her so she can talk with her grandkids. I proceeded to step back but not too far away. Less than a minute later the lady handed the phone back to me and said that my phone wasn\u2019t working. The screen had red and black Chinese characters on it. I was very confused because it was working just fine just before I handed my phone to her and it was apparently factory reset. Apparently my phone (the Chinese One Plus 3) had a security feature in it that I didn\u2019t know about that will factory reset the entire phone if too many attempts at the fingerprint sensor is made.\nSo I had to go through the entire phone rest process again, had to hunt down Wi-Fi so I can reinstall all my apps from my google play account. I checked my contacts and only my contacts saved on my sim card were still there. All my photos have been gone except for the photos I\u2019ve taken because thank the lord for google drive. I lost a lot of files but it was okay, if I lost it then I lost it. \nThe fuck up hit me when I tried to access my Gmail account because I set it to ask for my personal Google Authenticator code whenever I logged in, I opened my Google Authenticator app and it had been reset too. I scoured all my files, plugged in my phone to the computer and did everything I could but the backup code screenshot had been deleted along with other files on my phone. I was still like oh well no problem I have another email I could use and I can always make another YouTube account. \nI\u2019ve been casually involved with Cryptocurrency for the past year and a half and put in a few hundred here and there. I\u2019ve had some highs and lows with cryptocurrency but the last I checked I had roughly $12,000 dollars in holdings on my crypto wallet. Because my crypto wallet is so important I set it so I would need to provide my Google Authenticator code every time I logged in but I don\u2019t have access to my Google Authenticator anymore \u2026 so effectively I\u2019m cut off from accessing my crypto holdings that I worked so hard to build up for. \n\n\n\nEdit: just want everyone to know im in the process of removing my google authenticator from binance. Process will take a week or so but i should have my moola back. It's been a wild ride.","57":"There is a hell of a lot of context so you're gonna have to stick with me here. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was around 12 but even before then my Dad and I weren't really that close. For the first couple of months after the divorced it was great! My dad made time to see me, he only lived 20 mins away and we were closer than ever. Then he met her. They met through mutual friends. She was a widow, 9 or so years older, and lived 6 hours away. At first I was really happy my Dad had found someone and immediately a couple weeks into them dating I met her. She made lewd innuendos in front of me about what they were going to do later, spoke over me and refused to eat anything at the restaurant I chose because she \"doesn't like Spanish food\". A month or so later I get a call from my dad saying that he had moved the day before to where she lived and, therefore, couldn't meet up that weekend. He told me AFTER he moved.\n\nCue the next couple of years of her passive aggressively hating me at any family event and me only seeing my Dad twice a year as she cut his contact time down with me. At one point (~15 y\/o) she made my Dad leave me behind at my niece's christening so I had to go around asking for a lift back from the church. My two half-brothers (from my Dad's first marriage) even staged an intervention to try and get her to improve her behaviour to me.\n\nThen I came out as a lesbian.\n\nI came out to my Dad alone when I was 16 and he said he was completely fine with it. The next day she calls me up and says things that still scar me to this day. I have been incredibly lucky to have never faced that level of angry homophobia again in my life but it was horrific. My dad let her say these things to me whilst he was in the room. I am very lucky that my half-brothers\/ other extended family just completely ripped into him and cut off contact with him and I built myself up again.\n\n3 or so years pass and I get a call from my Dad saying that she had passed away from cancer and that he now wanted to get back in contact. I talked to my brothers and they have both met up with him to see what the situation is. She left him penniless they got married (secretly) but she left nothing to him in the will. He has been burning through cash like crazy to impress her and now has no job prospects, no family, no money, and no permanent home (he has a house for the next 2 years but nothing after that).\n\nHe's getting older and I don't know whether I'm going to regret not getting back in contact with him. He seems apologetic but I don't know whether that's enough for me to forgive him.\n\n\n\nEDIT\/\/ he also tried to steal my savings a year and a half ago but luckily was able to get it all back before having to go to court","58":"Background: So I used to work at a drugstore and before that I worked at a fast food joint, and a take 'n' bake pizza place, for a little while I was working at the drugstore and the pizza place both to make my ends meet. This last January I had a mental breakdown and kinda freaked out because I kept getting sick, then the local flooding was trapping me at home, then getting sick again, then getting flooded in again, and getting sick, and getting flooded in, you get the point. I had had to call in the last 4 days and when I finally did go in, as I was about to clock in, I just freaked the fuck out. So I quit. I had just started school, taking accounting courses because holy fuck do I hate the general public. I'm 3 weeks from the class ending. Obviously, I kept up with the school, and once it's done, I'm going to be looking for accounting jobs. I moved in with my ILs again on April 28th and it was going fine mostly. Also, my MIL is Bi-Polar and supposedly on medication and seeing a psychiatrist.\n\nBut then this morning happened. Technically also last night.\n\nMy MIL suggested I apply to PetCo down the road cuz she could get me an easy job there (I highly doubt it, but ok). Since I have a plan that my husband is totally cool with, I politely declined and explained I can't really work with the public cuz I had a mental breakdown, but was about to finish my accounting course and apply for accounting jobs. As evidenced by this morning, this apparently went in one ear and out the other.\n\nSo this morning, my husband and I are woken up to the lovely sounds of my MIL yelling into the phone about how I'm lazy and do nothing and I need to find a job or get on SSI and get a diagnosis cuz if I can't work, I need to be diagnosed.\n\nOk bitch, first of all, I am doing something. I'm going to school. Schoolwork doesn't take up all of my time. Second, I can work. Hence why I'm going to be looking for accounting jobs once my class is over. Third, I don't need a diagnosis because I know what's wrong with me and it's not what caused the breakdown (that was stress). I'm depressed as all shit, but being with my husband for the first time in 3 years has helped that a lot. \n\nAfter she's off the phone, my husband goes out and corrects her and reminds her that I told her I was going to school and that the semester was almost over and I was going to be looking for a job once that happened. They end up fighting because she's trying to defend what she said and straight up lies and says she told us that I needed a job to move in, which that was not the deal, then she tries saying that I needed to look for a job starting last Monday, which also was not the deal. Then she tries saying that if I don't have a job by July, we're going to get kicked out (FIL won't let that happen, everyone knows she's nuts). My husband stands his ground and reiterates what our deal was (paying half the bills, since it's him and I and MIL and FIL in the house). She then tries to demand more money and goes on about how she's gonna start charging us like we're tenants and charging us something ridiculous like $900 a month when it would've cost us significantly less to stay apart. I love my husband. I don't have to shine up his spine because he came with one! He flat out told her no. We had a deal, we're sticking to the deal.\n\nThe rest of their conversation is pretty confusing cuz she keeps getting off topic and trying to change the subject and he keeps dragging her back to what the conversation was actually about.\n\nMy thing is, as long as the bills get paid, who gives a shit? There was a long while when I was working and my husband (then boyfriend) wasn't and I got shit done and paid for. It wasn't a big deal, and it isn't now, and I don't see what the problem is considering I'm going to be looking for jobs soon. But I can't just yet cuz I need to finish this class. What is so hard to udnerstand about that? (Apparently everything!)\n\n\n\nEdit: and now MIL and FIL are fighting and she's telling him to go fuck me.... I hate my MIL....","59":"I was interested in going to an event with my boyfriend this Saturday. The tickets were $200 each, $400 total. I knew that if I let my boyfriend know the price he would tell me not to spend that much money on him and that the event would not be worth the price.\n\nI came up with the idea of telling him that my friend was selling her tickets to me at a significantly lower price because something came up and she would not be able to attend. My boyfriend agreed on going now, since the prices were much cheaper.\n\nI happily go on the event's website to buy the tickets, only to realize that the tickets were sold out, and the only ones available are  expensive VIP tickets.\n\nThen my boyfriend asks me if my friend has any extra tickets for sale, because he wants to invite his sister, who is graduating on this Saturday.\n\nRealizing that I can no longer buy the tickets at regular price and him thinking I have a friend selling me tickets for a cheap price, I tell him that it is fine if we decide to not go because he won't be able to invite his sister along. I was hoping he would call off the plans. Instead, he suggests I offer the tickets to his sister instead as a graduation gift so she can go with her boyfriend.\n\nI am left with two choices: Buy the expensive tickets for myself and feel resentment while at the event for spending much more than I was planning on, or spend that same amount of money on his sister's graduation gift and make him happy.\n\nI decided to buy the tickets as a gift for her. The worst thing is, I do not like his sister. I highly dislike her.\n\nWhat to do! Boyfriend already told his sister, and she seems happy and told him to tell me thank you. If only I checked the website if it was still on stock before lying.......yes, i can still request a refund.\n\nNow I know my lesson. No lies, no matter how big or small.\n\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Boyfriend decided he wanted the tickets for us to go. he took them back and now his sister is disappointed. i have created a mess.","60":"My aunt owns a Cabin in the mountains, it's nice this time of year because it's close to ski resorts and has a very nice wintery feel. \n\n2 years ago my Aunt agreed to let my wife and I use it. Initially it was just supposed to be us 2. But as time went on and we were unable to find time to get away we missed the opportunity 2 Winters in a row. \n\nWord about the cabin got out to my wife's family and they expressed interest in possibly joining us if we ever decided to, or found the time, to go. \n\nI was fine with this. It was just me and her and her parents. Then her sister and nephew were added to the discussion without really asking me. But I was still okay with it because I love her family and we all get along well. \n\nSo we found a weekend to go and everything was looking fine. Then I find out that my wife's niece was also invited without asking me. I grit my teeth a bit simply because I wasn't consulted about it but in the end I was still okay with it. \n\nNow this trip has transformed from something that was just supposed to be my wife and I into her family trip to my family cabin. I'm okay with it. But a bit annoyed that my trip was \"taken over\".\n\nI was asked (I was finally asked!) if the niece could bring her new girlfriend (the romantic type. They are both 18.) To which I said no. I was not comfortable with that because this girl is a stranger and my wife's niece doesn't exactly have a great track record of making great decisions. \n\nI didn't feel comfortable bringing a stranger that I can't vouch for to my family cabin. \n\nAll of a sudden people are angry that I would deny her GF the opportunity to go and spend time with the family. And since the trip is a month away I have \"plenty of time to get to know her\" (their words). And \"it's only one person and we approve of her. It's not like she's bringing a bunch of people you don't know.  As if it's my job to go out of my way to vet the girl and test to see if she can earn my approval. \n\nAt this point I don't think I even want to go anymore. This whole thing has morphed into something that I don't recognize as the cozy little get away that I planned with my wife 2 years ago. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\n\n\nEdit: because I've been accused of having a problem with her sexuality twice now allow me to clarify:\n\nI have absolutely no issue whatsoever with her sexuality and I have no idea where that sentiment comes from. \n\nI have a problem with her decision making. She wrecked my wife's car less than 6 months ago 6k worth of damage. Driving the car without permission or insurance. We got the car fixed and signed it over to my wife's mom for the niece to use on the condition that she would treat it with the respect that she lacked when she wrecked the car. She has proceeded to smoke and drink in the car (both activities for which she does not meet the age requirement here) and hot boxes it with her friends and girlfriends regularly. It's disrespectful and I don't particularly want that type of disrespectful behavior at my aunt's cabin. \n\nHer sexuality is a non-issue. I fully support relationships of all kinds. Gay, straight, bi, trans, whatever. You do you.\n\nEdit 2: my wife seems to be getting more \"hate\" than I feel she deserves so let me say this:\n\nMy wife fully supports my decision and is backing me up to her family. She is taking the brunt of the ire coming from them and defending me. She doesn't agree with my decision and would prefer I allow the GF to go, but is defending me all the same. She has my back in this whole thing. My wife initially invited her mother and father, and asked me for permission in that regard. And I was fine with it. It was at that point that my MIL started the invite train. I don't feel my wife has done anything wrong. She may be guilty of lack of confrontation towards her mother, but my wife is very non-confrontational so I don't fault her for that. \n\nWife has my back.","61":"So, when I was about 23, Ditchmom had her first heart attack.  She was a long-haul truck driver at the time, and it was very difficult for her to make the lifestyle changes necessary to reduce her risk.  So, naturally, her first heart attack was not her last by a long shot, and she was having them again within a few weeks.\n\nI'm told that heart attacks tend to fuck with the brain, and that a cardiac med cocktail of the intensity and volume Ditchmom needed would have *also* fucked with the brain.  I should, apparently, forgive her for the sheer *awful* she subjected us to because of that.  (Spoiler: I don't.)\n\nDitchmom's mental health had always been shaky.  I mentioned the TBI, the native Cluster B shit, and the history of CSA already.  So when her cardiac symptoms and medications started fucking with her brain chemistry even more, she was  not starting from zero.  A more normal person might have had some tactless or childish or difficult moments.  With Ditchmom, it was like somebody had opened the top of her head and poured straight evil in.\n\nIf anything at all about her day went some extremely loose definition of wrong, nothing could make her happy.  I once left a dish in the sink after lunch and was subjected to a top-volume screaming tirade that went on for ten minutes.  But even then she wasn't done: she was sulky and passive aggressive for the rest of the day.  OVER A DISH.  IN THE SINK.  WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PASTA SAUCE ON IT. \n\nOnce, Ditchmom halfway tore the house apart screaming that she couldn't find her keys, and I had the temerity, the absolute *gall,* to point out that the car keys she hadn't been able to find were in the exact same spot as always.  I shouldn't have fucking bothered, because that earned me a fifteen minute screaming rant about how soulless, evil, and selfish I was.  FOR FINDING HER KEYS. \n\nBut you're not here for the minor, day-to-day drama.  You're here for the shit in the title.  So gather 'round:\n\nAbout two months into the unending fucking nightmare that was my mother on cardiac medication, my dirtbag aunt got reactivated from the reserves and re-posted over in Djibouti.  That's a whole story in itself, but the upshot is that my uncle was alone in a house with four somewhat traumatized children, and since my mother was so very unsatisfied with living with me and her third husband, it worked out perfectly.  She went down to Florida to terrorize them for a few weeks, and her husband and I would stay in TN and be very, very fucking glad that she was gone.  It was heaven.  I went to work, I came home, I walked the dogs, I played my video games in peace and ate whatever I wanted and all was well with the world.  The husband picked up some short-haul jobs and we had a very pleasant time of not seeing each other, ever.\n\nI made the terrible, terrible mistake of taking a bath after a stressful day of dealing with the utter asswipery that goes on in an opioid-prescribing pain clinic.  Ditchmom arrived home just as I was getting out, so I greeted her in a bathrobe and helped her bring her suitcases into the house.  Ditchmom thanked me for my assistance and went upstairs to unpack, right?\n\nHAHA, no.  Ditchmom grabbed me by the arm and towed me to my bedroom on the first floor.  She shut the door and leaned in close, like LBJ or Kevin Spacey on *House of Cards*, and demanded, in the low, poisonous, hate-fuelled demon voice she'd adopted since her heart attacks:\n\n\"Are you sleeping with him?  Did you fuck my husband while I was gone?\"\n\nMy flabber was fucking gasted.  I said something like 'what no what the fuck WHY,' but it was incoherent because *what no what the fuck WHY*.\n\n\"What are you doing taking a shower in the middle of the day?\"\n\nOkay, record scratch: it was fucking 7PM.  A perfectly reasonable time to have a \"my day was stressful, I deserve bubbles\" bath.  I stared at her like she was crazy, and although she clearly realized how fucking irrational she was being by the embarrassed look on her face, she just had to barrel on.\n\n\"I mean, it's not the first time I've had to share a husband with you.\"\n\nAt which point, I lost my fucking shit.  \"YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING BELIEVE ME,\" I howled, because I gave no fucks who heard us.  \"You didn't even fucking believe me about it at the time, and now you're using what YOUR HUSBAND did to me WHEN I WAS TWELVE as GROUNDS FOR SUSPICION?\"\n\nThat shut her up, and we were able to move along like it hadn't happened, which was really the best either of us could hope for, at least until I was totally done with her shit, packed everything I could carry into my car, and drove south to get the fuck away from her.","62":"This is a short one. And also my first post here.\n\nI work at a Motorcycle shop,  we have a service bay where we also do work on cars and trucks, but mostly its just friends, family and staff who get their vehicles done here.\n\nA few months ago I leant my Playstation 3 to the Mechanic since his Xbox barely works, and when it does his 3 kids are fighting over it.  Money was a little tight one week and I had recentley bought a PS4, And have a PC too.. so I just asked him if he wanted to keep it.  We agreed on a price, but then a few days later he remembered it's November, and we are in Canada.. and I hadn't had my winter rims installed yet,  so instead he offered to do my wheel and tire change for free as payment for the Video games and such. I agreed\n\nHe asked I come in early this morning so he had time to do the wheels \"off the clock\" incase he got called out first thing in the morning,  I didnt get much sleep last night, So I felt a -little- bit drowsy this morning.  I dragged my ass out of bed, got dressed, and beat it to work.\n\nPulled in the lot, there was a bunch of trucks all over the yard, and he was standing in the bay door area, talking on the phone and motioning for me to come in.  \n\nUntil Today I've had a spotless record with driving, I had to give it some gas to overcome the incline and the lip at the top of the ramp to get into the garage,  I came in a little too fast, and the way I came in, the car bounced and I bumped something on my undercarriage or bumper on the angle of the door lip.  My Co-worker made an \"ouch, that poor vehicle face\" and so did I... except I was more focused on cringing over the admittedly minor bump.. I forgot to move my foot.\n\nI floored it. On the gas pedal.\n\nLet's just say I stopped it in the nick of time.  I slammed on the brakes But had a split second panic because the car was moving so fast, it didn't stop on a dime, it was a RWD Car, so it seemed not to respond to the braking as I was still coming over a lip at the time.   Co-worker had to back pedal and if it had gone another foot I would have pinned him to the wall.  Put the car in park and I just opened the door , both of our faces were white as ghosts and I just sat there profusely apologizing.\n\nI logged on the Security system to get the video, but our cameras suck, they only take pictures like every second...  but here's a video too\n\nhttps:\/\/i.gyazo.com\/aff15efa9aac2e191beed1ec474245a9.mp4","63":"There was an after work event this week. A coworker was leaving for another job and we were going out for light food and drinks. I don't drink btw. I didn't give my husband details because he usually doesn't ask nor appear to care that I attend these occasional outings which usually end by 6-7pm. \n\nHere's kind of a text log to get an understanding of what happened. \n\nHusband 6pm: You have that thing tonight right?  Need dinner after?\n\nMe:  Should be out of there by 8 and fed, no worries about dinner. Times are estimates. \n\nHusband: Ok. \n\nNote the following I didn't see until the train ride home at around 11pm. \n\nHusband 930pm: Hey baby, everything ok?  What's your status\n\nHusband 1005pm:  All good?\n\nHusband 1030: Hey, give me a ping getting worried. \n\nMe 1033 (sent by asshole coworker): Hey buddy, chill the fuck out. She's in really good hands, I can assure you ;). \n\nI left my phone at the table and asshole coworker took it upon his drunk self to send that text. Yup my iPhone 4s is not password protected.  I didn't see any of my husbands texts because his notifications had been cleared when asshole coworker opened up messages. I saw it as soon as I got in the train and texted him immediately. \n\nMe 1105:  Babe, sorry that was not me!  See you when I get home. \n\nNo response from husband. \n\nWhen I get home he is in bed, I give him a kiss on the cheek and he doesn't reciprocate. I ask him what's wrong and he says he doesn't want to talk because he's afraid he'd say something he regrets. \n\nThe next day was totally ghosting. He finally approaches me tonight and says that he felt extremely disrespected and is suspicious of my inattention. He said he wasn't keeping tabs on me but making sure I way okay since most of these wrap up by mid evening. \n\nI profusely apologized and tried to defuse. He wasn't all that receptive. He said he's not sure what to think. He had total trust in me but thinks something nefarious must have been happening for this guy to have my phone and feel bold enough to send that text. Him and I, back and forth, no improvement. \n\nHe finally dropped a serious bomb. He says he doesn't know what to think. But he said that if there's any hope of him believing this was as I say (as actually happened) that I can't be in his words \"the same fucking room with that fucker\". No after work events, if there's a work meeting he wants me to notify HR that there's a personal conflict.  He's heated and said if I can't meet these demands then I can either look for another job or a new husband, my choice. \n\nEverything is happening so fast. I know he's over reacting, but he does have his reasons. I have bitched out the asshole coworker. Told him off and told him if he touched anything that belongs to me again I'm going straight to the police.  What my husband is demanding is not practical. \n\nI guess I'm asking if I should risk waiting this out for cooler heads to prevail. Or meet my husbands demands. Or if there's something I can do otherwise.  I am pretty sure he thinks something happened that night. I think if he was assured it is what I say it is he'd move past it, but I can see from his perspective it looks like shit.","64":"So this happened earlier today over the course of about 3-4mins, some relevant background; I broke my ankle and a few toes (on opposite feet) weeks ago, my cast was removed 3 weeks ago so I\u2019m mobile and now down to using  one crutch, mostly for balance. \n\nThis has meant that my brother has been chauffeuring me around everywhere, including to and from work. He was running late today so I wobbled my way down to a supermarket to grab milk etc and told him to pick me up outside the store at the little pick up\/drop off point by the entrance.\n\nSo I was sitting on the bench outside the store when a wild MIL appeared, with her DIL and grandkid. I\u2019m not sure how old the kid was, I\u2019m no good at judging kids ages, but based on her stream of babbling, I don\u2019t think she could speak just yet. She was sitting in the little chair thing in the trolley and seemed to be quite happy. MIL was an older woman who was walking slowly but seemed to be fine.\n\nDIL parked the trolley and kid beside me and told MIL to wait here; she\u2019ll go get the car so MIL didn\u2019t have to walk across the car park. From what I got from the conversation; MIL had been moaning about her feet and wanted to sit down. DIL was trying to get her to sit on the bench and MIL was martyring herself. I promptly put a stop to all of that by offering the MIL my dry part of the bench and moving further away to lean against the wall. MIL didn\u2019t even look at me before sitting down like she\u2019d just been crowned.   \n\nDIL kissed the kid, told her \u201cmummy will be back in a moment, you be good for Granny and then we\u2019ll go for a fun ride in the car\u201d. Kid\u2019s happy and excited for car ride, mum disappears.\n\nAs soon as DIL was out of earshot the MIL tuned to the kid and said \u201cYou\u2019re such a bad little girl. See, mummy\u2019s leaving you here. She\u2019s gone without you. No car for you\u201d. Cue kid bursting into tears and *screaming* for her mum. I\u2019m not sure how much the kid understood of what the MIL had said, it may have been all or she could have just understood the \u201cno car\u201d part, either way it was a shitty thing to say to your grandchild (or any child tbh). \n\nI looked right at her and gave her the raised eyebrow look and some serious glaring, which probably gave away the fact that I\u2019d heard her. She completely changed her tune, loudly telling the kid that she was \u201conly joking\u201d and \u201cmummy will be right back\u201d etc. \n\nThis didn\u2019t really have much effect on the kid and she was working herself into a right state, so the MIL decided to take her out of the trolley seat.\n\nShe plonked the screaming kid on her feet then *turned back to sit on the bench*. Guys, this kid could have given Usain Bolt a run for his money. The moment she had her (not particularly stable) balance she made a run for it screaming for her mummy. \n\nStraight towards the road.\n\nThere was about 15ft between the road and me (still leaning against the wall) and about half that between the kid and the road. In the time it took for me to realise the kid was heading for the road and that MIL hadn\u2019t seen a thing, the kid had made it pass the bollard (there are bollards outside shops in the UK, I\u2019m not sure why but I have theories).\n\nI have *never* moved so fast in my life, I managed to grab the kid and make it back to the pavement before my ankle realised that a full sprint this soon was *soo* not a good idea. Neither of my legs were interested in supporting me after that so I just sort of crumpled into a heap on the pavement with this kid. \n\nThe next thing I know the DIL is there taking the kid from me, it was her car that she\u2019d run in front of.  \n\nDIL was crying, the kid was crying, I was crying (it fucking hurt) and MIL was *still* sitting on the bench. \n\nAnyway, I blame it on the adrenaline\/pain because normally I wouldn\u2019t get involved but I told the DIL *exactly* what had happened, all of it, even what MIL had said to the kid. When I left DIL was still screaming at her MIL.\n\n**\n\nEdit: I'm happy to say that this post actually has an [update](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JUSTNOMIL\/comments\/55vj9o\/mil_in_the_wild_youre_such_a_bad_little_girl\/). I'd like to thank everyone for their comments and of course for the gildings.","65":"Well I fucked up a few weeks ago but the consequences have followed me to this morning.\n\nI manage a dive bar and usually I\u2019m by myself during the week. As soon as we opened at 3pm, I had two incredibly obnoxious older men come in who were having a few drinks before a football game nearby. As I knew they were leaving and it was quiet I was pretty lenient with them. They made some weird creepy comments like \u201cdo I find older men horny\u201d as well as vaping in the bar, passing out on the table and requesting music (EDM when I was listening to Nick Cave...)\n\nOne of them loves the bar, like he thinks it\u2019s fantastic. He\u2019s the sort of older rich guy who just has an air of \u201cooh I\u2019m slumming with the young people!\u201d and asks if we can discuss booking his birthday here. I give him my email address as I\u2019m pretty sure he won\u2019t email, this isn\u2019t the kind of place where men like him have their birthdays. I have two email addresses for work. One is my personal one I use for live music, events, trade stuff and the other is purely for bookings. The booking one is also monitored by the owner in case I\u2019m away or whatever.\n\nHe\u2019s aware it\u2019s not my personal one but I manage to convince him it\u2019s just me who checks it so he\u2019ll definitely be dealing with me when he books.\n\nSkip forward to today, I\u2019d forgotten all about this and assumed the man had too.\n\nI woke up to several missed calls from the owner and when I call back, he is FUMING. He\u2019s telling me he opened an email where the subject was \u201cmy nickname\u201d and was filled with filthy shit and a picture of a hard dick.\n\nThe owner assumed that as he knew my nickname (I didn\u2019t want to give him my actual name) he was a friend of mine and I was using work property for some weird fantasy.\n\nThankfully he understood when I told him what actually happened and I still have a job. He\u2019s printed out the email, pic included, and it\u2019s now on our notice board.","66":"For once, this actually happened today.\n\nThe story, however, starts last night when I was scrolling through facebook and came across a typical click-baity article about how someone got a nasty eye infection because they didn't properly care for their contact lenses. I didn't pay much mind to the article itself, but figured I should refresh my memory on proper contact lens hygiene (I've been wearing contacts for years, and figured there might be something I might not remember from when I first started wearing them at 16).\n\nSo I look up proper hygiene and most of it is stuff I already know. (Don't sleep in them, don't lick them, etc.). But then I came across a suggestion that says the brand of solution you use should change from time to time so that the bacteria doesn't get used to it and overpower the solution's antibacterial elements. I just so happened to be extremely low on my current bottle of solution and figured I should heed the warning and make an quick trip to Target and buy an new brand.\n\nAs I look through the brands, this shiny box with a cool looking contact lens case pictured on the front stands out (as shiny things do), and it has triple-cleaning action! AND it's on sale for $3 off! What a steal!  So I buy it and merrily make my journey home to try it out.\n\nI open the box, and look at the cool contacts case that's inside. It has a small cage to keep the contacts in, which then is submerged into a small container which would hold the solution. \n\nI think to myself \"This is complicated and looks like it wastes a lot of the solution, I'll just use my old case instead!\" And so I do.\n\nNow comes what happens this morning: I wake up for work, call my girlfriend (who currently is in Australia) and go about my regular morning routine. I get into the bathroom and begin to put the right eye's contact in, and then suddenly, I feel the burn of a million suns. My eye feels like it welds itself shut. I drop my phone and scream in an agony that I could have never dreamed of. I lay on the floor, curled up in a ball, trying to pry my eye open to get the contact out. \n\nAfter what felt like an eternity of suffering I finally manage to rip the lens out and proceed to effectively drown my eye in water for about 15 minutes before the burning even begins to subside. I grab my phone to hear my girlfriend, who was terrified that I may have had a heart attack or something, breathe a sigh or relief. I then proceed to scan the box of the solution for any information as to what could have possibly gone wrong.\n\nOn the back of the box, in a red box, it reads something along the lines of:\n\"Solution contains 3% Hydrogen peroxide. Only use provided case, not a typical flat case. Let sit 6 hours before removing contacts from solution to let solution neutralize.\"\n\nI go to the doctor, and thankfully there's no permanent damage because I rinsed my eye so thoroughly. But I had to call out of work today cause I'm am idiot.\n\n\n\nEdit 2: I swear the solution didn't have a red cap like a lot of you are saying. Just red plastic wrapping around the cap to first open it.","67":"Thanks for the support on my previous post, this community helps me keep my sanity. Again, I know my MIL is not anywhere near the cray cray that a lot of you have to deal with, so I really appreciate you hearing me out.\n\nSo this happened only a few months after SO and I started dating. Bear with me, there is some backstory. (Names have been changed for privacy)\n\nA few years prior to DH and I getting together, his parents went through a nasty divorce. I have heard bits and pieces from SO, FFIL, FMIL, and FSIL. SO reestablished contact with his dad a year after the divorce was done, because \"regardless of what may have happened, he has always been a good dad to me.\" I wasn't there for the NC period, but I have no doubt it was engineered by FMIL. FFIL is a really kind, funny, and awesome guy, he and I get along great. FMIL is not happy that there is any contact between SO and FFIL.\n\nAnyway, back to present day. SO calls me and asks if I will drive with him down to his house because he was worried about his roommate, \u201cAaron\u201d, who hadn't shown up to work (they worked the same job, opposite shifts). So I picked up SO so that he can keep trying to call his roommate.\n\nHalfway there, SO and Aaron's other roommate, \u201cBrad\u201d, calls. Brad beat us there, and found Aaron in his room, unresponsive. SO asked if he was breathing, and Brad broke down on the phone, and said Aaron wouldn't be getting up again. Brad says he is going to call 911, and gets off the phone. SO is obviously upset, Aaron was one of his best friends. Before we get there, SO calls FFIL because he works in law enforcement in the area that SO and roommates live. FFIL says he will meet us there. I am so grateful for how calm and collected that man was, it helped calm SO down a lot before we pulled in the driveway.\n\nIt was a long night of answering questions from the Medical Examiner, and officers who had responded to the scene. We were sitting outside for about an hour because they didn't want anyone in the house. Thankfully, FFIL was able to talk them into letting us sit just inside the door, it was cold that night. When it was all said and done, Brad went to stay with his folks, and FFIL followed us up back to SO's workplace, because Aaron's girlfriend had been trying to frantically get a hold of him (all three of them, SO, Aaron, and Aaron's GF work at the same place). FFIL was very helpful to SO when he broke the news to Aaron's GF, and was very supportive all around. Finally after a very long night, SO came back to my place to sleep. \n\nThe next day SO goes down to his place to meet Aaron's mom to let her in the house so that she can collect Aaron's pet lizard, some of his other things, and talk with both SO and Brad.  At some point before this, SO contacted FMIL, who freaks out on the phone, and says \"I'll be right there!\" Hanging up before SO can head her off.\n\nAll of them start working on packing up the house, because SO and Brad have already decided they will not spend another night in the house. Aaron\u2019s mother is keeping it together pretty well, a little teary, but not bad. She and SO get to talking about the night before, and she asks SO to thank FFIL for all of his help (FFIL spoke with her the night before and was helping her through the process of ordering autopsy, retrieving personal effects, etc). \n\nWell, FMIL hears them talking and proceeds to FLIP THE FUCK OUT. Screaming at SO that she can\u2019t believe he\u2019s still in contact with his father, why he would call him in the first place instead of her (she does not work in LE, and is not great in a crisis situation, obvi) and how he has betrayed her and all of this other bullshit, IN FRONT OF A WOMAN WHOSE SON HAS JUST DIED. FMIL storms out of the house and goes to lock herself in her car, sobbing uncontrollably and texting FSIL the \u201cdevastating\u201d turn of events. \n\nEveryone left in the house is dumbstruck for a moment. Then, in a moment that makes me proud, SO goes out there, pounds on the window until FMIL rolls it down, then proceeds to rip her a new asshole. How none of this is about her, or even about him, this is about helping a woman who just lost her son in a really terrible and tragic way. He also pointed out that she was not in a position to help the night before, FFIL was, and did so with flying colors. He tells her to leave because she is not being helpful or constructive, and is just getting in the way with her drama. Brad said he was dumbfounded, because SO almost never stands up to FMIL.","68":"Believe it or not this happened today and I'm still embarrassed hours later.\n\nMy friend had to get her wisdom teeth out this afternoon, and she asked me to drive her there and back and accompany her to her appointment because her parents are away for the weekend. Being the good friend I am, I obliged, even though the dentist completely freaks me out and the last thing I wanted to watch was my best friend getting teeth yanked out of her mouth.\n\nAnyway, her appointment was at 3 but we arrived around 2:45, and everything was fine. They strapped the laughing gas mask on her and she made me stand by her feet and give her a massage (I kid you not, this was her request). The oral surgeon began to yank her teeth out and I can't lie and say I watched, I kinda just turned around and told her everything was fine.\n\nThe surgery itself was going fine, all the teeth were out, and the oral surgeon said that he wanted to stitch one of them up. He was putting the stitches in and I wasn't paying any attention (stitches freak me out even more) and I noticed that there was a light stringy thing pretty close to the color of my friend's hair hanging way down by her leg. On instinct, I yanked it, thinking she had a hair stuck in her mouth while she was getting stitches. I thought I was doing her a favor.\n\nThought is the key word.\n\nTurns out I'm an absolute idiot and that it was the material for the stitches that were being sewn into her mouth, not a loose piece of hair. As soon as I yanked it my friend groaned and the dentist gave me a death stare (I kid you not) and asked me to leave and wait in the waiting room. Turns out I made it bleed a lot more than it was supposed to because of how hard I yanked the stitch. I'm just happy I didn't cause more damage than I did.\n\nMoral of the story, I'm pretty much an idiot and could've screwed up my friend's mouth just trying to pull what I thought was a hair out of her mouth. She thinks it's hilarious, but I don't think I'll ever be returning to that oral surgeon again.\n\n**","69":"Well so me and a few dumb ass friends were messing around in an online game, 5 of us to be exact (sub names are: brad, Arthur, Joseph, Nathan, and OP for story purpose). Story begins a Month ago when my bud Arthur brought up the Genius idea to change my name to something super offensive (Because the 5 of us have a dark sense of humor). Gave me enough In-game currency to change my name and get a skin (because wasn't going to do stupid name change without some small benefit). He gave me the name theSchoolshooter and without hesitation I changed my name. Eventually other friends came online to witness the fiasco of what my in-game name has become. They instantly became amused and decided to join in on the offensive name change train. Brad Decided to be Blkschoolshooter, and Nathan changed name to Gayschoolshooter (mentioning in-game names because they will be changed shorty after post, and because context). My friend Joseph changed it up and named himself 44Mag my teacher, because reasons. And for a month long we just play in-game saying dumb and funny shit in all chat, (for the lols of course). Was all fun in games with the occasional \"Nice dank name\" said from enemy team or random teammates. Eventually after a few weeks later or more like a few days ago we actually played a game vs a bunch of people who were devs of the game that we were playing (OP and friends have the best luck). Immediately in-game with awkward vibes all around, especially in all chat. Told us they were reporting our names in all chat the sec the match started. &gt;Tosses friends under bus for comedic purposes in all chat in a last ditch attempt to lighten mood. Later in same match we continue to stomp them outright and steamroll rest of the game (probably didn't help our case). We laugh it off for the next few days till this night. Then fast forward to tonight in the AM. I'm surfing Reddit then suddenly out of nowhere in the middle of the night, a loud knock on the door. it was a cop asking for me (OP has the best luck). I freak out internally but keep my cool. Officer wanted to talk to me about some fuckery that was going on in online game (Commie Russian role play, bigot posts in all chat and names of course). Told us we were possible suspected threats and are being watched by FBI (btw officer was super chill entire time while i was shitting bricks internally and externally). At this point he begins naming off my friends in-game names including mine (not saying arthur's cuz wasn't on same level as others). I begin to let out a small chuckle because of the absurdity of the names being said but manage to hold it in mostly. Tells me to just be careful of what i say online and tells me he understands that it was all just Dark humor (huge relief). I go back inside with the conflicting feeling of laughter paired with a scare trip. Check my group chat with the partners in crime. Arthur trips in chat while other friends are shitting bricks because cop showed up to his house investigating. Now 2hrs later and i'm now posting this and still sp00ked. will post update if there is one, no guarantee .\n\n\n\nedit: here is proof https:\/\/imgur.com\/ABs68aC\n\nedit 2: one of our buds was forced to cut ties with us R.I.P.","70":"I was already having a really bad day today (credit fraud, illness, and just a generally stressful workday), so when I got home from work I decided to cheer myself up by working on my first cosplay, which I started working on just a few weeks ago. I had the wig for the cosplay sitting in a bag, unopened, so I decided I would wash it and try it on. Took the wig out of the bag, looked up a tutorial, and washed it in my bathroom sink, then wrapped it in a towel to dry. No problem so far. So while waiting for it to dry, I put on the hairnet that came with the wig, to see how well it fit over my actual hair. Almost fits perfectly, but my hair grows really quickly for a guy's, so it would either stick out in the back or create an unsightly lump when I managed to get it all shoved in there. So, seeing a nice clean pair of scissors sitting there right next to the sink, I decide to give my hair a trim, figuring that just cutting a tiny bit on my own couldn't go too badly. \n\nFU#1- my hair looks from the back as if it was savaged by a wolverine.\n\nI look in the mirror, grimace a bit, but think \"oh well, I've never really cared about appearances, it'll just be a minor annoyance for a few days\", and then, as I'm cleaning all of the hair off the bathroom door, I have a fantastic idea. My girlfriend got off work later than I did today, which almost never happens, so I decided that I would surprise her by dressing up in my cosplay ensemble (at least, the stuff that I had already finished of it) and chilling on the couch by the apartment door so she would see it as soon as she got home. So I start searching for one of the accessories for the cosplay, and can't find it anywhere. I start panicking, since I put so many hours of work into this accessory, and can't remember if I saw it when I cleaned the apartment last week and threw a bunch of stuff away. I start tearing the apartment apart looking for it, even opening and sifting through a few garbage bags in case I threw it away. \n\nFU#2- ransacked my entire apartment a few days before monthly inspections.\n\nNow my hair looks terrible and I know I will have a lot of extra cleaning to do in the 3 days before apartment inspections begin, but at least I have all of the parts of my uncompleted cosplay together. So I put everything on, including the wig, which feels a bit damp, but not too wet at all, and chill on the couch by the door. This gets boring after a while, since I've forgotten when my girlfriend is actually supposed to be home, so I grab my laptop and decide to watch some videos. With my really nice pair of gaming headphones. Completely forgetting about all the moisture still trapped in that wig.\n\nFU#3- shorted out a pair of fairly expensive headphones, making that the third pairs of headphones I've broken in the past 6 months\n\nSo yeah, my day could be going a lot better. But I still have high hopes for my cosplay!\n\n\n\nEdit: haven't made many posts on reddit, edited slightly to make it more readable","71":"You can look at my previous post but I\u2019ll give a quick \n\nMy JN mom, Thorn, is one of those grandmas who lets her grandbabies do anything they want in her home and stuffs them with soda and junk during the duration of their visits.\n\nMy niece (6 y\/o) was jumping all over her couches. I totally understand kids will be kids and this is normal but since Thorn never warns or tells them anything, they jump on the couches in a dangerous way. They will stand on the arms and just flop themselves or things like this. \n\nWell my niece, while visiting Thorn, fell off the armrest and fractured her shoulder. My brother had to take her to the hospital.\n\nWell in my last post, I talked about how while my niece was in the hospital, she STILL allowed the kids to jump all over the couches and didn\u2019t tell them what they were doing was too rough and dangerous. I kept telling the kids and Thorn that one kid was already in the hospital and maybe they shouldn\u2019t be playing like that anymore... but that went no where. \n\nANYWAYS\n\nThorn was receiving pics of niece while she was in the hospital getting X-rays and getting a cast. Thorn kept sharing these photos to the fam text chat with tons of emojis and words that expressed how heart broken she was. Similar to this:\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd my poor ________\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\nShe continued to send pics of niece all night and during the morning she shared another pic and Thorn wrote \u201cNANA\u201d in BIG letters on nieces cast and bejeweled it. It was huge and it seemed like she just wanted to show off that she was the first to sign the cast and it will be hard to miss since she added a bunch of little sticky diamonds to her name. \n\nIt just felt like although it was part of Thorns fault, she turned it into a way to get attention. Like she cares about niece sooo much that she kept updating the family chat with pictures and sad emojis. Also, that fact that she wrote her name so big on nieces cast. \n\nYesterday my SIL was back home from her trip and in her Mother\u2019s Day pics with her kids (niece), niece had her cast in a black sling so you could not even see that huge \u201cNana\u201d \ufffd\ufffd","72":"I'm a guy who is a huge geek in my sophomore year of college. Nearly 4.0 grade point average, and a big-time calculus nerd. I'm not fat or anything, but I do have a bit of a belly from never going to the gym, ghost-white skin, and I have what my friend Ashley calls a \"cute bubble butt\" she says I'm \"hiding\" under my khaki pants all the time. So I have body-conscious issues too.\n\nI live at home with my family currently. And had a day off from school with everyone out of the house at work on a Tuesday at noon. I was having a new videogame delivered to our house, and was just out of the shower around noon when I thought I heard something at the back door. I figured I would just run to the door, grab it real quick, and run back in.\n\nWell, I underestimated my awkward geekiness. As I opened the door and hurried through it, my towel caught on the chair and I tripped and stumbled forward outside. Suddenly the door swung back, hit my white butt, and I was now locked in the backyard BUTT-NAKED!!!\n\nAfter standing there panicked and red-faced wearing nothing but my glasses for what seemed like forever, I knew what I had to do. The spare key was under the potted plant in FRONT of the house. So I tip-toed like a spy, bare as can be, all the way around to the front of the house. And it wasn't there!!! So I tip-toed my naked ass to the backyard again, hoping to shield my white bod with bushes.\n\nI then realized the key was actually moved last month to the garage. I had exposed myself to the front of the house for no reason!\n\nWith absolutely no cover in the backyard, I then had to steel myself, take a deep breath, and go streaking naked across the backyard to the garage to grab the spare key, and streak back. \n\nIn the middle of my run in all my glory in broad daylight towards the key, I turned to see our attractive 45 year old female neighbor with the biggest smirk on her face, drinking in my every movement of my run, and every jiggle of my bare butt, as I scampered into the back door to hide my shame.\n\nIt was so embarrassing (I'm blushing as I type this), and if I told anybody I knew, family or friends, they would just laugh their heads off imagining their nerdy friend naked as a jaybird running for his life.","73":"Miffled Mrs Bennet: my mother. On the subject of babies, she lives for them. I think she wanted a bunch of kids in the hopes that she would have mini Miffleds: just a few humans in this world that understood her. So 100% of her \u201ctime\u201d went into her kids. (Did your eyes get squinty too, after reading my previous posts?) She has no friends, and no hobbies. She has her kids. \n\nThose kids aren\u2019t babies anymore, and they certainly aren\u2019t mini Miffleds. She really did try. I heard a lot of whispered, \u201ctrain up a child the way they should go, and they won\u2019t depart from it,\u201d while growing up. \n\nThis takes us to today, or, the last seven years, really. You see, SO and I have been trying for kids for a year now. We will have an appointment for further testing soon. I want this kiddo SO BADLY. I come home and cry if I spend too much time with my friends kids. It\u2019s bad. \n\nI\u2019m also terrified of Miffled and the rabies that will set in the minute I give in and tell her I\u2019m finally pregnant. I read all the advice here. I\u2019m saving up all that advice. \n\nAnd, for your Llamas, here are the cringeworthy bits from Miffled over the years: \n\n- After the dissolution of my child marriage, I vowed never to marry again. I wanted kids though, and stated I would adopt around the age of 30. This trigger Miffled Rage Monster Mode. She only wants NATURAL GRANDCHILDREN. Don\u2019t worry, she will pray for the right man to come along, so don\u2019t adopt any time soon or that man will never accept me!\n\n- my 27th birthday card was actually a letter to tell me that she was now ready for grandchildren. She told me to wait when I was in school, but now I\u2019m out of school. So I can let go of that advice. Because now I\u2019m 27. \n\n- I made a lie of omission, such that she would think I told her I was sterile. That birthday card was just too much. I even explained to all my younger siblings my genuine worry about not being able to get pregnant after years of poor adherence to my BC without one pregnancy scare over the years. They grey rocked her when she asked, confirming her worry that I was sterile. She stewed for months over it, until word vomiting to Dad. Turns out she thought that our emotional distance would be rectified once I got pregnant. Surely I would understand her and come to appreciate her viewpoint once I had kids of my own!! I\u2019ll finally need her!\n\n- Miffled and Dad just sold the family home and bought a new place in town on the lake.  They didn\u2019t downsize. Why downsize when the grandkids will need room? (I\u2019m the only sibling who is financially and age appropriately ready for kids. I\u2019m several states away)\n\n- At brother\u2019s wedding last month, the topic came up while all of us were in the hotel hot tub. (Middle Sister later fessed up that she was trying to see how red Miffled\u2019s face could get while in public.) SIL and Younger sister doesn\u2019t want kids. MS wants her doctorate and 8-10 years before kids. You could see the red turn to white once that hit her. If I\u2019m the only grand kid giver, and may or may not be sterile, and am traveling around the world so often........WHERE WILL SHE GET THOSE GRANDKIDS.","74":"When I met my now husband he told me he was in the middle of a divorce...which I found out this week was not completely the truth.  He wasn't in the middle of a divorce the divorce hadn't even started. But there was a break in their marriage because he had moved out 4 months prior to us ever meeting, so when I met him he was what appeared to be a man living alone, while trying to iron out all the complications of a divorce. They had a kid together so it also seemed logical that he was in contact with his ex during this time, and spending time at the house. Turns out she was still under the impression that their marriage was intact, that the move out was just him needing some space for the time being and he strung her along for those 4 months he was living on his own, as well as an additional 2, almost 3 months, into our relationship. They would make plans together (he would cancel last minute because he was with me) She would try desperately to be a good wife to him (probably hoping he'd come back) send him I love you text...to which he'd respond back with a \"love you too\" or the dreaded \"luv ya\" She'd offer to make him breakfast before work or dinner after work to get him to come by the house...sometimes he would go most of the time he wouldn't. He was pretty much using her while he tried to figure out what he wanted. And there were other things like we took a weekend trip about a month in, and had one of the best weekends ever, we still talk about it to this day...and he had sent her flowers during that trip. Probably because of his guilty cheating conscious. \n\nWell one day social media does what social media tends to do and it got him caught up. He never used Facebook but did have an account, which made him tag-able. We went on a trip with his friends and during that trip his friend tagged him in photos of us together, his mom commented on the photo pretty much calling him a POS for what he was doing to his family. I was like WHOA...what am I mixed up in? He had told me before his family had turned on him and did not approve of his divorce so he had pretty much cut them out of his life, so again I had a reason as to why his mom was so irate over seeing him with someone else. And again, divorce is messy so none of it seemed that suspicious. Well it turns out that was the incident that actually ended his marriage, because THAT is when his ex actually filed for divorce. \n\nFinding all of this out actually made things much more clear for me, I was always treated like I broke up their marriage but I always thought I had nothing to do with it, from my perspective they were done months before I ever met him and were just handling legal things. That was not that case. \n\nSo here is my dilemma now, what do I do with this information? There is:\n1) do nothing, it was so long ago, there is nothing to gain from it. We have such a great marriage and relationship, what's the point? I was really mad when I found out and now I don't know how I feel. I,too, have been in limbo in a relationship, where things are done but you're too scared to pull the trigger, so you just end up being a shitty person till the other party has had enough of you.\n\nOR\n\n2) Bring it up. He was technically cheating on me too. There are so many moments in the beginning that are now tainted or would have never been had I known the truth. I would never disrespect another woman or a marriage like that, and yet I did. And because of the position he put me in, I had to take years of being treated like scum by his family. And I also wonder, had he not got caught, how long would that have gone on?\n\n  ---   \n  **","75":"Finally a place to discuss this! Backstory- I moved in with my SO when I was 18 and he still lived with MIL. MIL would still invite his ex over once in a very blue moon- its my SO's only ex. They dated five years and ex basically grew up in MIL's house even though they arn't really cut from the same cloth and didnt particularly love each other. MIL is a power house, self made, very ambitious and smart. Ex is a lifetime waitress, self proclaimed gamer, sleeps life away and immature. \n\nI played my part well and told them both if they wanted to see her from time to time I completely understood and all I asked was to be told before hand. I'm the opposite of jealous or possessive, even tried to help ex out every once in a while from afar. Until several months into relationship she was still texting him somewhat inappropriately and I then let everyone know I was uncomfortable with her in all of our lives, being that she used them for money and other things. \n\n2 years into relationship I find out SO had been sexting ex for 6 months or so. She sent him a lot of dirty pictures and he sent her a lot of money. We spent a year fixing all of our much deeper issues that had led to that, he made it up to me, etc etc. \n\nSO and I both told MIL what had happened as a way to say its time she cut his ex out of her life. She basically laughed it off, so I told her very seriously what a deep and complicated effect that betrayal had on me. How very very important to me it is that the ex be cut off. \n\nWe are now 5 years into relationship and MIL still WILL NOT LET GO OF MY SO'S EX. Any time I bring it up (once every 5-6 months) MIL tells me I need to not be jealous or that I am obsessing over the past. This girl has had 2 marriages since she dated my SO, she has her own MIL to lean on. My MIL justifies it that she has 15ish dogs and needs someone that knows them well to watch them while she travels. However she doesn't travel anymore and ex is at her (my family's) house 2-5 times a month. I was never this person before.. but now knowing that that vile, lying, user of a person is buddy buddy with the future grandmother of my children, that she kicks her feet up in my old house, that she even occasionally sleeps in my old bed drives me up the freaking wall. And MIL thinks I'm crazy for letting it drive me crazy.","76":"This is double barrelled; let's take this step by step. Also, \n\nOne, I feel like lower budget films are a lot more enjoyable. Personally, I think too much money ruins the movie \"objectively\", because it signals too many hands in the pot and too many people messing with the end result. Call me a purist, but I like it when the film is directly translated from the director's and screewriter's (sometimes the director is also the screenwriter, but not always) minds. \n\nMy favourite movies have terrible budgets, but they compensate elsewhere. Locke has a gripping plot and a fantastic moral. It also has a very unique setting. Low budget does not mean terrible effects and \"boring\" movies all about the story (a lot of people seem to hate movies that emphasise on the story). Moon was visually fantastic on a one mill dollar budget. Both Sky Captain and Cloud Atlas did fantastic with their budget considering the scale. The former was challenged with fresh technology, the latter had almost 4 hours of runtime to produce. Both were spectacular.\n\nThere are many more examples.\n\nLet me move on to my next point, which goes hand in hand. A lot of the budget gets carted off to pay J Law, or Will Smith, or whomever. For this reason, most low budget movies I see have pretty obscure actors, or better, kind of well known actors who're in it for the experience.\n\nLocke featured Tom Hardy, who played Bane, Mad Max, and soon, Venom. Yet the budget for Locke was an abyssmal 2 million. Nightcrawler featured Jake Gyllenhaal, but ran on 8.5 million. And Buried starred Ryan Reynolds, but survived on a 3 million budget. \n\nHere's my summary.\n\nLow budget movies are often better, and these movies may contain actors that are less well known, or well known actors not like themselves (I didn't recognise Will Smith in Concussion, as an example), but I don't feel discouraged.\n\nPeople always say \"who tf is in this movie\" or \"wtf this looks low budget af not watching this\", but they're really missing out on good, wholesome films.","77":"I'm almost 16 years old, and for about 3 years now I have this rule with my parents that if I want something other than basic food on the table, a place to sleep and clothes that my mother or grandma don't want (from time to time), I have to buy it myself.\n\nThe problem is that in my country the only job a teen can really get is giving people leaflets during events, and it takes you forever to have enough money to spend on stuff. I tried to make it another way, by drawing portraits of parents' friends and family. It wasn't much better, and took a lot longer, but allowed me to do it without it colliding with school hours.\n\nAfter 3 months of working practically every day, no social life, and a minimal amount of sleep, I finally was able to buy my first mobile phone (Samsung Galaxy S7).\n\nWhen it arrived, I was so fucking excited that when unpackaging I dropped it on the floor. The screen wasn't exactly scattered, but it had a small purple dot at the side. For the next two hours, I watched as the dot was spreading, slowly covering the entire screen until everything went black.\n\nI still don't believe it. Thought that I could maybe go and repair it somehow, but it's even more expensive than buying a new phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Unfortunately I won't have my money back, I talked to a guy from the company who sold me the phone and he said I clearly damaged it myself so yeah...no refund for me. But the good news is, I will be working part-time in my friend's parents' cafeteria, so in a few months I will hopefully be able to buy another one, from a more verified source!","78":"My wife is amazing and since this is anonymous and a throwaway I am going to brag. She is smart, sweet, sexy and smoking hot. She is an amazing mother and caring friend\/daughter\/sister. She is always going out of her way to make others feel loved and cared for and her cooking and baking would make you weep. Her picture should be next to nurturer in the dictionary. She is 5'6\/120 with perfect t&amp;a even after 4 children. She has a dynamite smile and a cute laugh that will knock the wind out of you. Even her name is beautiful - Samantha.\n\nThis isn't all bias either. Anyone who knows her would say the same. On the other hand people who see my wife for the first time think I am joking. No way a chubby, hairy mother fucker like me got a girl like that. I'm 6'4\/300 of muscley fat. I believe homosexual fellows would call me a bear. I've got a scar from my lip to mid cheek. I work a blue collar job and always have grease under my nails from some project I'm in the midst of putting together or taking apart. Oh and fuck you genetics - I am losing the hair on my head but the body is just as hairy as ever. For some reason Sam adores me.\n\nWe have a great life together though. She is a stay at home mom, we've got four great kids - had our last 4 months ago. Nice house. Two cars, two cats, two weeks of vacation and no lie we even have a picket fence. Thanks for reading so far. Now I'll get to the actual shit that happened.\n\nSaturday was a family BBQ for mother's day and I happened upon a conversation I wish I had never heard. Her aunt, cousin and a family friend were talking about how happy they were to hear she was done having kids. How they would have never guessed her life would be this way. How she wasted her education, she should be a reporter like she dreamed of. That she should be married to Todd. Fucking Todd, her college boyfriend, who is a goddamn weather man now. They don't know what she sees in me. (Her cousin called me a fat sack of crap.) Why she ever married me. How she could be happy playing suzie homemaker. Thats not the girl they knew. The ambitious go getter. She shouldn't have the life we have together - she should have a better life. With less kids and more luxury and no me.\n\nWell now I feel like a fat sack of crap. Never have these relatives ever given an inkling that they don't like me. Never has Sam ever given an inkling that she is unhappy. She did want to be a journalist and worked in print before we had kids but she gave that up to raise them hands on. I feel like shit over this and I don't know what to do or say about it.\n\nSam knows something is up. She knows I'm not my usual self and something is bothering me. She isn't pressing the issue but she has gone into nurture mode. She made my favorite dinner tonight just to cheer me up. Even made chocolate cake and homemade peanut butter ice cream. I wanted to cry. She's been extra flirty and flashed me some sexy panties and a wink while I was putting the kids to bed. It is all just making me feel worse. \n\nNormally I'd talk through any problem with her but what do I even say? \"Are you sorry you married a fat hairy bastard and had four kids with him?\" Do I tell her that her aunt was talking shit about her?\n\nI'm in my garage and I just can't go in the house. I feel like a useless jerk who ruined the most wonderful beautiful girl in the worlds life. I don't know if there is any advice to be given here I just really needed to get this all out. Feel free to tell me to man up or whatever. I just feel awful over this. \n\n   \n**","79":"I love my mum. We haven\u2019t had a normal mother-daughter relationship (I lived with her for about 3 years and with other family for the 19 other years). But what I\u2019ve noticed is that she loves spending and giving to the point where it is way too much. She helps me out a lot where I need i.e. most weeks she will ask me for a grocery list, I text it to her and she buys what I need. I am extremely grateful for this but even in this situation she always buys a lot of extra things that I don\u2019t need (5 tomatoes instead of 1, or chocolates I didn\u2019t ask for). \n\nOther times she will guilt me into saying yes to letting her buy me things. One time we went to the hairdressers together but I was taking longer so she went shopping on her own for a bit, comes back and asks me what new iPhone I would like. I said no it\u2019s fine, my iPhone now works perfectly but she kept on insisting and I really didn\u2019t want to fight in front of the hairdressers. So I got a new phone when I did not want or need one.\n\nAnother instance was when I casually mentioned that I was planning on saving up for a new camera len. The next day my mum called me saying that she was already talking to the salesman and she needed me to hurry up and choose which one I would like. I felt trapped in that situation and just let her do what she wanted otherwise she would have gone that whole way over nothing and gotten mad at me.\n\nMoving on to the current situation. I have just finished my final year of university and have been planning for over a year to travel around America with my best friend Caleb to meet our other friend Lauren in New York sometime next September. However, my mum has been pressuring me and boyfriend to make him fly with us. She even said that she will pay for half his flight. But the thing is we have planned this as a friends trip and my boyfriend doesn\u2019t even want to go\/does not have the money saved up to py for half. She mentions it everytime my boyfriend and I come over and I think this is turning into an \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to fly to New York unless I bring my boyfriend to protect me\u201d. She has even joked about coming along with us too. \n\nI really need advice here as I never want to come off as spoilt or ungrateful and I definitely don\u2019t want to make my mum mad or have my friends have to thirdwheel with my boyfriend and I since we have been planning this trip for a long time. Also, my family is not rich. In fact, my stepdad is currently unemployed and there is no way that paying for my boyfriend to travel with me won\u2019t result in more debt.","80":"I'm on mobile, sorry for any formatting issues.\n\nSo it was my birthday recently and I'm one of those people that love to celebrate birthdays. Not to the extent of expecting a  \"birthday week\" or any of that silliness but I do get very excited. This year it was also special as I turned 21.\n\nNow my issue might be a non-issue but I still feel hurt over what happened and maybe you guys can give me some advice. I have been planning my birthday party for a while (just a gathering with my friends with alcohol and pizza, but still special to have everyone together). All throughout the planning a very close friend of mine, \"Sarah\", has helped me and told me she'd make a cake so I wouldn't have to worry about that too and she'd bring me a card game so I wouldn't have to buy it. Now, she offered those things and I thought she was being nice and I was grateful... Everything was great, I sent out the invites to my party a couple of days before so people could give me a heads up if they'd be attending.\nNo one declined. Awesome.\n\nThe next day Sarah sends out her own invites to a party the day before my party\/birthday to all people I invited. I was a bit taken aback and told her that I thought that may not have been the best idea to which she just replied that people [implying she was referring to me specifically] should be more spontaneous. \n\nThe week went on, I dropped by her party to be polite but said I'd be leaving early as I had stuff to set up for my own party, in response to which half the guests seemed very confused as they though we had just \"merged parties\" and mine wasn't on anymore. I was a bit hurt but assured people that I would still be celebrating my birthday. Now to how this came to affect my party the next day:\n\n- one of my friends said he couldn't come due to what sounded suspiciously like a hangover from the previous night. When I asked my other guests they high-fived for making him drink that much. \n\n- Sarah told me casually that she'd be late for my party (by 2 hours) and when she showed up she fell asleep almost right away as they had partied until way  into the morning. She didn't bring a cake either as she had served it at her own party. \n\n- nobody wanted to drink with me as they had done so excessively the night before, neither did they want to play games as they said they had \"played everything\" the night before. \n\n- The conversation mostly revolved around during inside jokes from the previous night that I of course didn't understand. \n\nBottom line? I feel my party sucked I  comparison to hers the day before. I wouldn't have minded at all had she had a party the day after, I would have happily attended. But the way it happened made me feel like she tried to squeeze her party in to get attention. \n\n*\n\nEDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up. There's a lot I want to say but people seem to confuse reasons I give for her behavior with me trying to rationalize it. If I say the reason she did it was for attention, that doesn't mean that's okay. At all. It was a shitty thing to do, and the more comments I read (sorry for not replying to all of you but thank you for your time!) the more I know I have to talk to her.\nThe question was never whether or not to cut Sarah out of my life, I have had truly horrible friends in my life, so I know the difference between someone using me and someone just being shitty. When I said I've had to defend myself on previous occasions, it was all regarding her change since she got dumped. She's miserable and self-centered. The latter alone doesn't immediately make a bad friend, in combination with the former however it becomes toxic fast. I know that doesn't mean I have to put up with it all, I have enough problems as it is.\n\nHowever, she has supported me through hard times in the past, and I am not the ugly girl that gets to be with the cool guys through her. She's no Regina George, as people have mentioned. She's an insecure but outgoing 20 year old that lives by the rules of Instagram and let's the attention get to her head. Do I approve of that? No. Does it affect my life? Not until this incident, and I will not have another one like it  follow. Thank you for your replies. I'll talk to her when I see her next.","81":"Hello, I need advice. \nI'm 21 and work two jobs, both fast food and I hate it. A lot. \nI love this makeup store that I shop at and not to toot my own horn but I'm pretty great at makeup.

I brought up me offering her those jobs and she went off saying how she's tired of working food and how she wants to move up so I told her \"So do I, but I'm willing to do what it takes to keep my head above water and so should you.\" Then I told her to walk in and talk to them like I did and now she's saying she can't do it until tomorrow and other excuses. \nIt's pissing me off because I was so happy about this and now she's making me feel like I stole something from her just because she doesn't have a car or the motivation to do what I do. I'm debating on just telling them I'm not interested and recommending her instead. \n\nUpdate: Me and her have talked it out. She apologized for being jealous and told me it's due to her barely pulling $400 a month at her current job and that she sees me always going and doing and not worrying about bills because I work two jobs. I told her she still has so much to be hopeful for and that I'd do anything to help her out if need be because she's like a sister to me. \nI'm going to the interview Monday and ive already ironed my outfit and know EXACTLY how bomb my face is going to look.

Things went pretty well for first period, I was just a little bit on edge, but, during second period, things took a turn for the silly. I had sat in the back of the class because everyone else had already picked their seats. The teacher opened up with a pretty normal introduction to the class, but then suggested that we take all information down on the slides, because this is one of the most important classes of the year and all of the information will be in the exam...\n\nSo, I got to typing my notes and was focusing really hard, because even with a computer, I type slower than most people write and was having a hard time keeping up. Eventually, I started feeling light headed, but I figured I was just hungry and ignored it. Shortly after that, I started seeing spots in my vision and my head was pounding like a drum, but I still just figured maybe I was sick and would leave after class. But then, I started to feel the world spin, my hands and feet got pins and needles, my vision had become nothing but a tunnel and I felt like just going to sleep, even going so far as to laying my head down on the table...\n\n... it was at this precise moment I realized I hadn't taken a breath in well over a minute and in a panic, I gasped as hard as I possibly could.\n\nApparently, I gasped so loudly I caught the attention of the entire class, the lesson having stopped and the teacher started to approach me, visibly annoyed and said:\n\n&gt;T (teacher): I understand that this lesson is lesson is of great importance but have I really said anything worthy of a gasp, Mister P (me)?\n\nall eyes were on me, I felt like shrinking out of the room, and, not knowing what to say, I said the truth.\n\n&gt;P: No miss... I uh... I just forgot to breathe.\n\nand for the rest of my senior year, that was the joke of the class.\n\n\n\nP.S. I may end up posting more regularly on this subreddit, I have a... colorful history of poor choices and luck","83":"Hello reddit.  A few things are changed here for the sake of anonymity because I have no idea if my daughter has a reddit account.  Anyway my daughter Claire is transgender.  She has known this since the age of 11 and so have I.  We have been to a psychiatrist and she's been on hormone blockers for a few years now.  But she has only just recently at the beginning of the school year come out as a transgender woman to the rest of the world.  I'm so very proud of her.\n\nNow for some background.  Her father and I married young and we were separated when she was just a toddler.  I got primary custody because he was often in and out of jail for petty crime.  He got visitation.  One day a month and she visits his family for Christmas Eve and Easter because they are pretty religious and those are the holidays they like the most.\n\nFor the past few months, my ex Jeff has been 'too busy' to take Claire on their once a month bonding day.  She looks forward to it because she has a lot of fun and her dad basically spoils her.  I thought it was suspicious that this started as soon as she came out but Clair always sees the best in people.  I finally got confirmation this weekend that it's because he thinks I ruined our 'son'.\n\nHe says until I make Claire stop this nonsense that he is not coming to see her and that she is no longer invited to his family for holidays.  His mother called me as well and said that it's my fault she's like this because I raised her with no male influence.  I told her I wasn't the one who raised her son to be a criminal with no reliability.  I lost my temper at her and I regret it but I want to protect my daughter.\n\nClaire has been excited to see all her cousins since a lot of them are young and she loves playing with kids and babies.  She doesn't know yet that she has been uninvited because she is trans, or as they say 'a mentally ill freak'.  How do I go about telling her this without breaking her heart?  Or making her depressed?  I know we can always do something together that night but she loves traditions and they're important to her and it will hurt her to know that her family thinks of her that way.\n\nSorry if I rambled I just want to do this right.\n\n   \n**","84":"This has been something that has been bothering me for a while, me and my partner have been together coming up 5 years and during our 5 years together she has never had an orgasm, we have tried everything and she's never had one, she's always reassured me and said our sex is amazing and \"better\" than her ex, and I've also always really enjoyed sex with her even tho I've never managed to make her orgasm, I always put it down to my penis size as I am only 4 inches long and just over 4 inches girth, however my girlfriend has always told me that size doesn't matter and that I'm a perfect size for her, we've talked about using toys like a vibrator before but she said she wouldn't be interested and she prefers \"real sex\" \n\nGetting to the main story my girlfriend mentioned to me a few weeks ago that she always fantasised about having a threesome with two guys (MFM) I said to her that I was up for trying something new, i was very surprised as my Girlfriend never seemed the type to be more \"adventurous\"  and I was curious as to why she suddenly wanted to have sex with another guy, she explained that it was always a big fantasy of hers and she was embarrassed to ask me, I was quite excited to try something new with her and especially a threesome, I said she could pick a guy (as long as it wasn't a friend) and I'd sort out a hotel and a date. \n\nShe eventually found a guy after a long search (a lot of fakes and people ghosting and some disrespectful) she asked me if I would be bothered if he was a little bit larger than me and I said it wouldn't bother me as she always told me size doesn't make a difference and it's skill more than anything, the date came and we got down to \"sexy time\" she got on her knees and started giving me a blowjob and I was extremely turned on, she was rubbing the other guy through his trousers and then pulled them down.. What flopped out wasn't something that was \"a little\" bigger than me but A LOT bigger, the dude must have been pushing 7.5+ long and 6 girth... Nervs started to kick in a little as she was enjoying blowing him a lot, however I kept in my mind that my gf had told me that size doesn't make a difference and it's more skill (but if that was the case why did she pick a guy with a large cock?) \n\nWe got down to PIV, taking turns doggy style as we had agreed and her taking turns riding us, she was extremely loud with him, a lot of eye rolling, panting, and a lot of swearing, she was quiet with me and seemed less \"into it\"  bear in mind as well my girlfriend is the type to be very very quiet during sex and very reserved! she didn't feel very tight during PIV for myself as well, I can only describe it as an extremely sloppy\/loose feeling, not something that I was use to, she pushed me to go deeper a lot and I obviously physically couldn't, half way through I decided to take more of a back seat and let her blow me while he was pounding her doggy...\n\nShe started arching her back, panting a lot and swearing and then WHAM, she had a massive orgasm, her first in 5 years and I was absolutely devastated  that I couldn't be the one to give her one, he finished inside of her 5\/10 mins later ( we had STD checks on him prior as we weren't taking any risks) she cleaned up and the other guy left\n\nWe had a massive argument after, I said to her why did she pick a guy with a big cock if she told me that \"size never mattered\" to her? And I said that I was devastated that she had a orgasm with this guy, she said to me  that she couldn't control herself and the orgasm just happened, I also was very angry that she didn't include me more in the threesome and again she just said she \"lost control\" and was extremely into the other guy, I asked her flat out again why she picked a guy with a large cock, and she shouted at me saying that she \"actually wanted to have good sex for a change\" she explained to me that she wanted to experience sex with a larger guy and the orgasm just happened, and she wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was, she said that recently she had been talking to her friend about her new boyfriend who was very well Endowed, and it had peaked her curiosity, she also explained to me that she thought that my size was maybe a problem why she was struggling to orgasm, something that she had always denied, I was absolutely crushed, and I now I have the image of that guys huge cock pounding my girlfriend to orgasm stuck in my head, it's not healthy for my mental state and I have recently been going in a bad state of depression.   \n\nWe haven't spoken properly in days and I'm not even sure how we can go any further with this relationship, if anyone has been In a similar situation I would appreciate some advice, I appreciate opinions from women as well!!","85":"Long story short, my wife and I have been married for 2+ years. She's known I've always had trust issues after getting cheated on, which honestly left me jaded. In the past there have been fights between us, as guys she used to sleep with (she even recognized as not 'dating') have messaged her wanting a hook up. As far as I'm aware she's never indulged too much in talking about explicit stuff, but certainly talks to them\/ acts some-what flirty even after they've said trash about me, or she fails to mention me at all. In transparency I have been a bit nosy, and I'm at fault for that -- you're bound to find something bad if you look, and that is an invasion of her privacy. Regardless, the other night while I was watching videos on the computer with my daughter I see a notification for some message on Facebook. It didn't recognize who it was so I checked it out. It turns out it was from one of her close friends, and she was logged in. I then noticed towards the bottom and message between her and some guy, with the last message reading \"Thanks boo\". I could immediately feel the blood rushing, and my anger setting in. I read the message, brought my daughter upstairs, explained to my wife that I wanted to show her something, and brought her to the computer to see what it was. From there, I told her what I had seen, and I went through it line-for-line. The look of guilt and shame on her face was there, and she kept apologizing and asking if she should go. I told her I wanted to put the kids to bed, and we'll talk after. We did that, and afterwards I confronted her. I explained how although what she said at most was PG, the context and lack of regard for me as a person made me sick. Not only that, but she continued to flirt with this guy, and send pictures of our kids after he opened the conversation and continued to joke around about \"being a step-dad\", to OUR kids. To give some perspective on her, she's had a history of severe depression and is currently medicated for anxiety. She's also a stay at home mum, to our three kids, and I work full-time and also go to school full time. I think she feels nostalgia for when things where simple, and when she was a little more 'free'. I think sometimes it's one thing for your husband to value you sexually and physically is one thing, but sometimes you do need it externally. I don't at all think that justifies it, but I do think it's worth mentioning, as these situations are complex. I just wanted to get some of the sub's feedback on how to digest this, any advice, really just anything at all you have to say about this situation from a woman's perspective. \n\n  ---   \n  **\n\nBelow are some of the things she said that were the most hurtful for me:\n\"Could you handle 2 kids?\" in response to him telling her to divorce me, \"I'm a good catch\", \"if you liked it, you should have put a ring on it\", how she missed the times they'd hang out together, and complimenting him on his looks, and how he should have no problem getting any women.","86":"This might be a simple fix, but here it goes anyway.\n\nI have a friend from college who is getting married next September. She told me about it over the summer in one of the few and far between conversations that we've had in the past few years. After college, she moved from Michigan (where I still am) to Colorado and I barely hear from her anymore. The thing is, even when she was still in Michigan, I hardly heard from her anyway. Which makes it weird that she would ask me to be in her wedding, let alone maid of honor. We've had many falling outs and getting back togethers, only to fall out again. I call her my fair-weather friend, because she only seems to talk to you when it's convenient for her. I have tried many times to call or text her, only to be ignored. Until she has some big news to share, then she suddenly reappears. \n\nWhen I found out she was getting married, I knew I would probably at least be invited. The wedding is in Colorado though, and between getting time off from work, the flight, the hotel, etc., I knew I wouldn't be in the best financial situation to go. Then she suddenly started calling me all the time (while I was at work or the gym, so I didn't pick up). When I didn't answer, she would text \"Call me, I have something to ask you!\" That's when my \"oh crap\" meter started going off. I knew she was going to ask me to be a bridesmaid (even more money I don't have). She finally caught me at a time I could talk last night and she asked me to be maid of honor. And I didn't know what to say. I wasn't planning on going as a guest, I was going to let her down gently as a bridesmaid, but the maid of honor? I don't know what to do. \n\nHelp?\n  \n  ---   \n  **\n\nEDIT: She did mention \"helping me out\" with the financial side of things, something I'm not comfortable with (I don't like when my parents give me money, why should I let her?). I am planning on telling her no, wishing her the best, and sending a gift when the wedding gets closer. A lot of you had some great suggestions on what to say, and I'll let you know how it goes once I talk to her again.","87":"Obligatory, this didn't happen today. Let me take your minds back to the summer of 2016.\n\nIt was towards the end of June that myself and a group of my friends decided we would go to the party location Magaluf, in Spain. The first night we went out at around 11pm, little did we know this was an early start to the nights out there. We stayed out until around 6am and headed back to the hotel room.\n\nWe then went out the next night, and the next, and the next, and then one night, I commited a FU. \n\nAll I remember was knocking on my hotel room door. Opening my eyes, looking down, staring face to face with my flaccid phallus and unable to work out whether I was in a dream or not. I pinched myself, and it hurt.. so I used that as evidence to support the case of reality. I stood there for a few moments, banging on my hotel room door, figuring out what the fuck to do. I was completely naked, locked outside my hotel room on the 3rd floor of the hotel.\n\nI had a few options; wait for someone to open my door if I could wake them up, take the elevator down to the bottom floor or run down the stairs to the bottom floor where reception is. I didn't like the last options, so the banging continued. A few moments later, a security guard came up to the floor with a Spanish flag and the biggest fucking smile on his face. I wrapped the flag around myself and we proceeded to go downstairs for me to get a spare key.\n\nAs I was walking with him, I heard people laughing and smirking and making jokes and such. To be honest, Magaluf was probably the best place it could have happened as it was around 9AM (everyone would be asleep) and it's a party place, so things like this must happen all the time. I got a spare key, went back to my room and slept it out. The only reason I knew it wasn't a dream was the fact I woke up with a flag around me.\n\nI have an idea on what happened. At home in my bedroom, I have to stand up and walk out of my room, turn right and then there is the bathroom. The hotel room was laid out almost EXACTLY the same as my room, except the bathroom was on the inside of the door... not the out. I think I must have woken up (I sleep naked btw, it's so much more comfy!!!), my brain still asleep and in autopilot must have gone and walked out of the door to find the bathroom, realizing it's mahoosive mistake and then proceeding to slowly awake to the sunshine and laughs as it was making my hand knock on the door.\n\nI want to go back :(","88":"I(21m) have lost all respect for my sister (26). \n\nIt started when she moved down to Columbus to attend CCAD for animation and failed her first semester.... and then decided she needed to introduce more stress into her life by buying a dog. A large, expensive, high-maintenance dog, an Afghan hound, saying she \u201cneeds\u201d a dog. \n\nThe next part comes when I\u2019m in Columbus on a visit to a medical center to have a speech issue addressed. My mom decided we should stop by my sister\u2019s apartment, and when we arrive, the place is disgusting. Not only is there trash *everywhere*, there\u2019s two birds in one cage, neither of which are even hers, there are particulates floating in the air. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I am 100% serious about this.\n\nNext, a few months later i find out she\u2019s short on rent. *Again.* And my mom has to pay for it. \n\nFast forward a couple more months, she\u2019s almost evicted for not paying rent, and my mom can\u2019t afford to pay it, so she has to start asking members of our extended family to give her money so she can pay it. \n\nSome other time along the way, I was forced by our mother to give my sister about $200 from *my* financial aid money that *I* need for *my* schooling to her. \n\nAnd then around Thanksgiving she visited, and I hear her speaking with our father about how she constantly stress-spends her money. \n\nOh, and this one\u2019s a little petty: She calls me a weeaboo for liking anime while she\u2019s simultaneously obsessed with Korean drama, K-Pop, going so far as to teach her dog tricks in Korean rather than English.\n\nI just try to avoid her whenever she\u2019s home for holidays because I can\u2019t stand her way of life, but my dad thinks I\u2019m too harsh. \n\n\n\n-bought an expensive dog while on a tight college student budget (Afghan hound)\n\n-lived in squalor(She\u2019s moved now, but I can\u2019t imagine her new place is any better)\n\n-has 0 financial sense, wastes money and then leeches off of other people in the family\n\n-convinced our mother to force me to give her my financial aid money\n\n-hounds me about an interest of mine while being unhealthily obsessed with Korea herself\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way towards her?","89":"We live in a country where race is still kind of a big deal and she sometimes makes comments that I *thought* were satirical, e.g. \"All you want to eat is (ethnic food)\".  I always tell her to shut up because it's rude and we end up laughing at how stupid racist comments like that are, so I never thought she meant it. For what it's worth I'm bi-racial, half ethnic minority, half majority, she's ethnic majority.\n\nBasically I spilt food on the table a couple of weeks ago and she said, \"See, you can't eat properly with cutlery, because you're a (race-name) savage, you eat with your hands.\" I felt this was crossing the line a bit, I explained to her this sort of stereotype actually isn't funny, she said she'd stop.\n\nA week later I was out with an ex and she remarked that she didn't need to remember his name because all my exes, and myself, can be called by this racial slur. I said again this is not okay and she said she thinks she gets away with it because she's cute and it's funny to her. I said she should know I mind because I've told her before, and I've also told her I mind when other people do it. I also said she should stop because she complained a lot about people being racist to her when she lived in a white-majority country, so she knows how it feels. I told her I'm not mad with her but I won't encourage this.\n\nShe said \"okay, fine\", and since then I haven't heard anything from her in the past 2 weeks (we normally talk everyday). I'm not sure if I should reach out or just let it die? I kind of thought we were old enough that we could just apologise and move on, but her silence makes me feel like she isn't sorry, and I am wondering if I over reacted.\n\n\n\nEDIT; I really appreciate all the comments. She has just texted me to ask how I am and I'm not responding while I think this through. I feel like a thorough apology is in order, if we can resume the friendship without resentment on my side.","90":"Okay, so, LTL FTP &amp; all that. Also on mobile, so apologies.\n\n(\n\nI am currently busting myself out of the FOG with my mother &amp; it sucks. All my life everyone has always told me how great she is &amp; I totally drank the Kool-aid. But recently she went waaaay too far &amp; my eyes were ripped open so now she's in time out &amp; for the first time in my life I am no contact with her (or vvvvlc? She's blocked everywhere but FB but I never respond to her on there. IDK.)\n\nSomeday when I have more spoons I'll type up the BIG THING that she &amp; SFIL did to force us to go NC, but for now, a small snack because it's kinda driving me insane.\n\nWe have a DD (5) &amp; DS (2). DD is in her first year at school (kindergarten) &amp; loving it!\n\nYesterday she &amp; her class did a recital for Veteran's Day &amp; it was crazy adorable. My D(arling)H is a vet &amp; he actually teared up during it. It was just that sweet.\n\nAnyway, I took a million pics, of course, but we don't like showing DD's face online (we did when she was a baby but now she's more identifiable so everything previously posted has been locked down &amp; we try to stick with pics that obscure her face now). So the pic I posted to my own, extremely locked down FB page was one where her back is turned &amp; she's excitedly pointing us out to her teacher.\n\nIt's totally adorable.\n\nMy mother, who doesn't understand what \"do not contact me for the foreseeable future\" means, tried to share the photo. I clicked \"ignore request\".\n\nSo of course she got the message &amp; backed off, right?\n\nHaaaa, no. Of course not.\n\nInstead she saved the pic, re-uploaded it TWICE &amp; each time SHE HAD IDENTIFIED THE WRONG CHILD AS \"her girl\".\n\nI had deliberately blurred EVERY KID but DD, but you can CLEARLY see the child she circled cannot POSSIBLY be her.\n\nFor one, DD has long, gorgeous brown hair. This little girl is blonde.\n\nTwo, DD doesn't wear GLASSES. The little girl does.\n\nDH thinks she's doing it on purpose to get a response. He still seems to have faith that she can't possibly be this stupid. I have my doubts. I feel like she absolutely COULD be this stupid &amp; it's driving me insane.\n\nAnyway, of course both photos have been reported. I'm waiting to see if they actually take them down &amp; then she's getting unfriended. (Which I should have done in the first place.)\n\nI'm just so disappointed in her. I guess almost 40 years of living in a FOG so deep it could be mistaken for Silent Hill &amp; suddenly stumbling out of it will do that to you.\n\n(Also we call her Beverly in front of the kids so if that name isn't taken, I'll just use it. Because there are way, way, waaaay more stories coming... unfortunately.)","91":"The other day I was seated in a restaurant beside a woman who had just become a grandmother. She was really nice, choosing to talk with me (who was linguistically handicapped), so we talked a lot about all kinds of mundane things. And as she was excited to talk about her family matters, we talked about her family matters. I heard, for example, that every woman, upon becoming a grandmother, feels and wants to behave as if the grandchild was her own child. She then lamented that she had to not show this urge to the actual parents and try her hardest to allow them to parent their child themselves. \n\nShe also told me that she really did not like the name that was given her grandson. And I mean she REALLY did not like it. To be honest, the name was a foreign one, rather rare, too, chosen because the child\u2019s parents liked an international celebrity (one I had never heard of though) with this name. I proceeded to tell her a story of someone I know having named their second daughter after the eldest daughter\u2019s best friend, and thus this very Scandinavian child ended up with a very Middle-Eastern name, totally out of the blue. The lady said then that yes, she also had named her daughter after an old friend of hers, against everyone else\u2019s wishes, even if the name in question was from a neighbouring culture and not her own.. and that actually she had started to grow accustomed with the grandson\u2019s name.\n\nShe originates from a culture where people show kindness towards their relatives and guests by infantilizing them and attempting to micromanage their lives, aggressively if needed, so I was rather impressed with her. She didn't say anything about having been told off baby-hogging or the like, but rather let me understand that it was all her own wisdom and own choice. Knowing the culture it's more than likely that she had had to deal with enough JustNoMilism herself before, and sworn to not follow the same path (which would explain the \"every woman wants\" thing..) I don't know, and I didn't ask. But I keep my fingers and toes crossed that she manages to keep the lid on her JNMILism, and may her daughter and son-in-law keep shining their spines and help(ing) her on her path if she tumbles.","92":"When I was 10 years old, it was a June 4th and I got a cast with the actual plaster because I fractured my pinky. Reason why? I had my hand opened when I blocked for a kick in Taekwondo sparring. I had to stop Taekwondo for some time. Anyways, let's get on to the story\n\nEM, EK (Entitled Kid), Me, SG (Security Guard), Mom\n\nSo me and mom were at West Ed Mall and I was getting my food at the food court. After I got my food, me and my mom sat down at a table. I told my mom I was going to go to the washroom so yeah, I did it.\n\nI was going into the Men's Washroom and after I pissed, I went to wash my hand and then here we go, our EK who is about 6-8:\n\nEK: Can I have your armour\n\nMe: *just realizing* No sorry this isn't armour, this is a cast because I fractured my pinky\n\nEK: Whyyyyyyyyyyyy, this is armour, I can tell cause it's hard\n\nMe: Sorry I really need it for pinky to heal\n\nEK: Awwwwwwww *gets pissed and walks away*\n\nAs soon as I got out of here, our star member come so out\n\nEK: That's him Mommy! *points to me*\n\nEM: *walks over to me* Excuse me, my son says you won't give your armour to him! Just give my angel your armour \n\nMe: No lady, this is a cast, I need it because I fractured my pinky and, it won't heal if I don't have a cast\n\nEM: CMON! My son has been getting so much grades, and you don't need that anyways! Your probably saving your own life instead of my poor angel's\n\nMe: No lady. Besides your son doesn't really need this, and again, this isn't armour\n\nEM: CMON GIVE IT HERE, IT'S PROBABLY JUST A BRUISE OR SOMETHING, AND I CAN TELL IT'S ARMOUR IT'S HARD. SO GIVE IT HERE \n\nShe actually tries to pull my cast out, but right on she can't since it is really wrapped around hard on my arm\n\nMe: ARE YOU THAT STUPID!?\n\nEM: HOW? YOU PROBABLY GLUED IT TO YOUR ARM SO MY ANGEL WON'T GET IT\n\nI pull my cast away and start walking back to my table while EM is REEEEEEEEEing out to me ranting about how I don't need that \"armour\"\n\n20 minutes into eating and I'm almost done my food, until I saw EM with the SG. SG approaches my table:\n\nEM: HA! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE NOW *to SG* Sir, this is the boy that stole my son's armour.\n\nSG: *looks at my cast and starts laughing* Ma'am that's a cast! Are you out of your mind?\n\nEM: B- B- BUT THIS IS ARMOUR, IT'S HARD AND IT HEALS THIS KID'S PINKY\n\nSG: Ma'am, this is a cast, it is used to heal a fractured, dislocated, or fully broken bone. And plus, this kid is way to young to be arrested\n\nEK: MOMMY MY ARMOUR \n\nEM: Don't worry sweetie, this evil cop and kid are trying to steal the armour\n\nAt this time my mom comes back\n\nMom: What the heck is going on?\n\nSG: Oh don't worry this mom and kid thinks your son's cast is armour\n\nEM: YOUR HIS MOM? GOOD YOUR SON HASN'T GIVE IN HIS ARMOUR BECAUSE HE THINKS MY ANGEL IS DISCRIMINATING\n\nMom: *she started laughing* THIS IS THE MOST IDIOTIC MOM I'VE EVER HEARD OF\n\nEM: HOW DARE YOU, IM NOT IDIOTIC, THAT IS ARMOUR YOUR SON IS USING I KNOW\n\nMom: *searches cast up and shows it to the EM: Lady read it\n\nEM: NO, I KNOW THE INTERNET IS LYING *she actually calls 911*\n\nSome time later, there is some paramedics. P if for The Paramedic that pretty much talked\n\nP: What's going on?\n\nEM: TELL THIS SG AND MOM THAT HE HAS ARMOUR\n\nP:  *looks at my cast* Ma'am, this is a cast, where do you get this information?\n\nEK: Oh I got it from minecraft\n\nEM goes pale white and grabs her kid as she runs away\n\nThe Paramedics head back to the hospital as EM wasted their time\n\n\n\nMoral: Don't take MC too seriously\n\nEdit: Edited some 911 logic","93":"If you've been following the story so far, I'm sure it doesn't come as much surprise that SO and I did eventually procreate. When we found out that I was pregnant with baby number one, I was so excited. Not even Tweedle could wreck that for me. Oddly enough, I quickly became her favorite person. First grandbaby. So even though I didn't like her, she suddenly wanted to be best friends. Wanted to take me to all the appointments, babysit constantly, hinted to SO how she wanted to be in the delivery room, etc. All of these because \"Well, your mom lives out of state and you'll want someone with you for all of this!\" Yeah. I will. What the hell do you think your son is going to be doing??\n\nShe wanted to be the first to know about everything. Due date. Gender. The name we picked. It was irritating.\n\nNeedless to say, BIL and SIL always knew first, as we lived with them. SIL was crying next to me at the first ultrasound. My mom was the immediate second priority. I would call her and then we would call FIL, who would then tell Tweedle. \n\nFIL and I had a loooong talk about boundaries before I told him that I was not comfortable letting them babysit until she was a little older, a few months at least. He agreed. I also told him that I didn't want the baby at their house alone with Tweedle. He told me that whatever I wanted was fine with him, but that maybe it was best that we didn't word it that way when we told her and that he and I could just work that out when we came to that point. Seemed easier than a fight. I also asked him if he remembered the spanking conversation. He apologized and said that it was really insensitivite. He would freak if someone hit his kids, and he would never lay a hand to mine. I trust this man and his word explicitly, but just for good measure, I told him that if it became an issue, I would put my hands on him if he ever laid one on my kids. I also told him that it would be the last time they saw or heard from us. He promised it would never be an issue. \n\nDue date is set for March 2nd, 2016. I keep joking that since it's a leap year I hope the baby is born on February 29th. \n\nSO: Why?\n\nMe: Because then when they're asking me for a car for their 16th birthday, I can be like, \"A car? You're only four!!\"\n\n(SO, FIL, BIL, and SIL all laugh)\n\nTD: Well, I think thats just mean.\n\nMe: It was pretty obviously a joke. Sorry you didn't get it, the rest of us had a good laugh. \n\nCue CBF from Tweedle.\n\nSO and I find out we're having a girl. Tweedle freaks out because she has 4 boys and \"can't wait to dress up her granddaughter\"! I told her if the clothes she buys the baby are anything like the obnoxiously sparkly hoodie she bought our dog that she will lose that privilege reaaaal quick. FIL cracks up. Cue CBF.\n\nWe pick the name, which for obvious reasons, I will omit. Suffice to say that she shares her first name with a leading lady in a very well-known play. WE DID NOT NAME HER AFTER THAT CHARACTER. So because Tweedle is by law required to annoy me, every time she tells someone the name, its \"like from the play!\" And then I correct her. It's not like the play. Its not even spelled the same. \n\nIt only got more fun the closer we got to her due date.","94":"So my brother and some friends and I decided to buy a microwave and some random shit from goodwill to microwave at our house one summer. We got a bunch of silverware, a doll head, a golf ball and a can of aerosol hair dye. We start out in the front yard with the silverware and it just sparked a bit, but nothing big. We then do the baby doll and it starts smoking so my friend grabs his emergency gas mask out of his car (yeah idk why he had that) and we play around with this half melted baby doll head for like 10 minutes. Then we go to microwave the hair dye. We put it in there for 10 minutes, and absolutely nothing happened. We then decided to put it in there for 30 minutes and then go inside and play mario kart. After 10 minutes our friend goes outside, with his gas mask on, and puts his head right next to the microwave to check out the hair dye, and nothing happened. 10 more minutes goes by, and I swear to god it felt like an earthquake just happened. The windows shook, our ears rang and smoke was billowing out of the microwave in our front yard.  The front porch was covered in black hair dye, the glass plate had shattered and shot across the yard, the front door and the hair spray\/dye bottle was across the street 40 feet away, and the microwave had been shot back 5 feet from its' original resting place. A couple days later we were telling the story and our neighbor from down the street heard it while she was working with her headphones in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;","95":"So there's me [29F], my best friend [29F], and her fiance [30sM]. They just got engaged last week. I'm going to be her maid of honor. Yay!\n\nHer fiance is fine. We're not BFFs or anything, but he's cool. He's kind of a socially awkward nerd, and it's hard to get him to open up without bringing up what he's most interested in (what he does for a living, whatever TV show he's watching) and then the conversation with him can get a little one-sided.\n\nMy best friend and I have been friends since we were 15. Five-ish years ago (before my best friend started dating her fiance), she and I watched The Wire together. We both now consider it our favorite show.\n\nAnyway, after watching that show, I started calling her, 'D' as a nickname, because, well, her name starts with D, and also, there's a character we both liked who was also called 'D.' I almost exclusively call her by her nickname now. \n   \n(WARNING. There's a spoiler for the Wire in the following paragraph, so if you haven't seen it yet, don't keep reading!)\n\nI got this very unexpected message from her fiance last night on Facebook. He told me that now that he and D are getting married, he kindly requests that I stop calling her by the nickname I gave her, as it's \"not a very mature way of addressing her. I would hate to think you calling her that during your speech at our wedding.\" He also went on to say that he never approved of that nickname anyway, because the character gets murdered in the show and he \"doesn't like that imagery associated with my future wife.\"\n\nI'm not the most diplomatic person, so I don't entirely know to respond. I'm not even entirely sure if I should say anything at all. There's, hahaha, also part of me that wants to send back, \"Sure, no problem, bro. I'll just start calling her Bodie instead. Or maybe Omar. Oh, I know, I'll start calling her Snoop! Snoop would be a *great* fit for her!\" A similar part of me wants to agree with him, and then during their wedding, just use her nickname constantly during my speech. And there's another (admittedly, angrier) part of me that wants to say, \"What? Are you kidding me? No. Request denied. Oh, and fuck you. Don't ever dictate to me how I should interact with my best friend.\" \n\nThere's also this weird...possessiveness associated with his wording the message. He never calls her by her name, just a lot of \"*my* future wife\" and \"*my* fiance.\" My best friend is fiercely independent, and I know she wouldn't appreciate being talked about like that. So maybe I should forward the message on to her saying something like, \"Hey...your fiance just sent this to me and I don't really know what to make of it.\"\n\nEDIT FOR AN IMPORTANT DETAIL THAT I FORGOT TO ADD: My best friend and I are both bisexual, and we have made out in the past. Just made out. A good handful of times in high school (we were like, \"We need to practice for our future boyfriends!\" but now that we're older, we laugh about all that now and are like, \"Right. Yeah. 'Boyfriends.' Sure. Uh huh.\") and, I dunno, four or five times in college (while drunk at parties). \n\nWe had talked about dating each other, but, I dunno...we love each other, but I don't think we would ever be *in love* with each other. We're pretty different people, which is why I think we make such good friends, but not terribly good significant others. The last time we talked about being in a relationship was, like, I dunno, 8 years ago?\n\nIt's now only just occurring to me that maybe this has something to do with her fiance's unexpected message...\n\nAny advice would be appreciative. Thanks, y'all.\n\n**\n\nUPDATE: Well! I just got off the phone with D. She called me, I started to answer like I usually do, (\"'Sup, D?\") But then, remembering that maybe she doesn't want to be called that anymore, I just sort of awkwardly extended the 'D' sound into her full name (so I answered like, \"'Sup Deeeeeeeee[full name]?\")\n\nShe immediately said, \"[Fiance] told you to stop calling me D, didn't he?\"\n\nI said yes, and she exclaimed, \"What the fuck, I can't believe he actually fucking did that! Look, I gotta go, I'll talk to you later. And *don't* stop calling me D.\"\n\n\"You got it, D.\"\n\nWe said our goodbyes and she hung up. Soooooooo...I think *someone* mighta crossed a line...\n\nUPDATE 2: I just tried to post an update, but it was immediately deleted because this post is still on the front page. Long story short, D's fiance crossed a line, they got into the most ridiculous fight, and she is at my place right now. Not entirely sure when (or if) she's going to go back home. I'll post a proper update as soon as this one is no longer on the front page.","96":"One rainy Sunday morning, I woke up with a craving for some filling, delicious pancakes. I was hungover and really out of it, but pancake mix is easy enough, so in 10 minutes I had a pan full of hot, tasty pancakes. As I grabbed a plate and brought it near the pan to transfer the pancakes, I got too excited and banged it against the hot pan - and the plate instantly shattered in my hands. Next thing I know, my pancakes and the ground are covered in shards of plate, and my foot has a 2-inch slice through the ankle, pouring blood.\n\nI didn't even feel any pain, I was so surprised and hungover. I just though, \"Well fuck. There go my pancakes\". I tried to put pressure on my foot to stop the bleeding, but it soaked through everything and I realized that the situation might be serious. I drove myself to the nearest ER. After a 3-hour wait, I was finally seen by some frazzled doc. He didn't really bother to check out the injury - just did a quick x-ray to make sure there was no glass stuck inside, stitched me up, and sent me home.\n\n2 weeks later, the stitches came out and I had a gnarly scar. But there was a bigger problem: after trying to walk normally for the first time, I realized that I couldn't lift my foot properly. Every time I tried to take a step, I stumbled and stubbed my toes on the ground. \n\nThis was alarming, so I called around and got the first available appointment with an orthopedic surgeon - which was over a month after the initial injury. When he saw my foot, he gave me a look that said \"You fucked up bad\". As it turned out after a bunch of tests, the broken plate had somehow stabbed my foot in a precise way to sever one of the most important tendons of the ankle.... the tendon that helps lift the foot during walking. The surgeon was flabbergasted and said the odds of that happening from a broken plate were 1 in a million. The tendon was supposed to be thick and incredibly strong, but I guess I beat the odds! \n\nThe worst part was that according to the surgeon, if the severed tendon had been found right after the injury, he could have easily just stitched it back together. But because I wasn't diagnosed right away and time had passed, the tendon ends had retracted far from each other. And severed tendons never heal. To fix it, I need to have a large and invasive surgery, with a cadaver transplant tendon, pins, screws, metal plates, and many months of pain and recovery.  The cost of the surgery at this point is more than I can afford even after insurance covers its part, so I guess I am living with a defective foot.","97":"I'll try to be short. \n\n\nBasically through the magic of DNA we found out the man supposed to be my DH's bio father, is not. Her first husband always swore my husband was a \"Smith\" and he was adopted by her second husband almost 40 years ago. \n\nWhen he first took the test I asked if there was any reason he shouldn't. She was evasive. When he matched distantly with a relative of the suspected \"Smith\" I asked again. No information\n\nNow he's matched with not one, but two of the \"Smith\" sisters as probable aunts. This means one of their brothers is his dad. No big deal huh? Just confirmed what was suspected. \n\nBut no, DH is pretty pissed. Not only does he feel she lied, but we are fairly close to the \"Smith\" family and apparently they all found out a few weeks before him. So now a few have been calling him cuz for a bit. He feels like everyone knew but him. He even argued with one guy that nope  he wasn't really related. \n\nSo now he expects me to talk to his mom and find out who the suspect is. I do not want to do this. I do not know what to say. How can I bring this up to her? She obviously doesn't want to talk about it.  And she's notorious for belittling other people's emotions. In her mind she got him a new better father and this is not important. How can I make her see that it's important to him. We're pretty LC due to many reasons. So her and I aren't close. Two of her four kids are totally NC already, I'd hate to make it 3.","98":"I have posted a couple times. This ones long sorry. \n\nWhen I was a teenager my jnmoms favorite punishment was to take the door off of my bedroom and bathroom. Didnt do the dishes? Say goodbye to the doors. Didnt clean her and my jnstepdads bedroom and bathroom? Goodbye doors. Wanted to hangout with friends after school? Goodbye doors for even asking. \n\nNaturally I threw fits about this. I'm a teenager and I need privacy. How can you make a teenage girl use the bathroom and shower without a door? Jnmoms logic was it didnt matter, teenagers have no right to privacy. \n\nAfter throwing fits about having no doors to change behind or do necissary bathroom tasks, I got timed showers added to the no doors punishment. 10 minutes max. If you went over the 10 minutes jnmom, or sometimes jnstepdad on jnmoms command, would come in and shut the shower off. Didnt matter if there was soap in your hair or you were in the middle of something. 10 minutes is 10 minutes. \n\nThen, my aunt got me this really expensive shampoo and hair mask to use. She made sure I new how to use them and wanted me to let her know how they were working for my hair. I had greasy hair with a dry scalp and she wanted to help me. Well, you see, the hair mask need more than 10 minutes to just be in the hair. So, I can use it with only being allowed 10 minute showers.\n\nThe next time we saw my aunt she asked how the shampoo and mask was working and if I wanted her to get me more. I then had the opportunity to have a little fun with the no doors punishment, in front of a house full of family members. I simply told her the shampoo was nice, but I hadn't been able to use the mask because I'm not allowed to take a shower for more than 10 minutes or jnmom would come in and shut the water off. \n\nI then had to explain more on that if I went over 10 minutes jnmom came in and shut the water off while I was showering. I also said I couldnt lock them out to prevent this because they took the doors off my bedroom and bathroom. Let me tell you, the room got so quiet after I said this. Everyone looked at me with confused expressions. \n\nI got a few \"oh, they are installing new doors so you dont have one for a little while?\" type of questions. While jnmom is staring daggers at me. I then had an opportunity to explaine to the whole room that, \"No, I had to stay late at work because we were busy. So I got home later than I normally would. Jnmom took the doors away because I was home later than normal.\" (I worked in food service, it sometimes happened)\n\nMy aunt then asked jnmom to explain what in the hell I was talking about. Jnmoms response \"Purpleplatypuss doesnt know what she's talking about. I'm allowed to punish my kids how I want\". Sound logic right? Needless to say jnmom got chewed out from all directions. There were threats that cps would be called if the doors weren't replaced and I wasnt allowed privacy. It was made clear to jnmom that if the doors were removed one more time there would be major problems. Family threatened to stop by randomly to make sure the doors stayed up.\n\nJnmom was pissed. I just made her look bad to her entire family. I knew there would be hell to pay, but my teenage self gave no fucks at that point.","99":"A long time ago when I was in middle school, My friend Steve (not his real name) and I would hang out at his house right after school. What was great about going over his house was that his parents didn\u2019t come home until later in the evening, so we basically did whatever we wanted. \n \nThis was a time before next-gen Xbox\u2019s, PS3\u2019s and shit, so we\u2019d usually play super smash on the gamecube, ride bikes outside, smoke some of his dad\u2019s cigars, crank call people, and other typical juvenile shit. One thing we use to do a lot was play this trap game where one of us would wait in a room for 5 minutes while the other set booby traps in the basement. After the 5 minutes were up, the person who waited comes out wearing a blindfold and has to walk to the other side of the room without falling victim to whatever trap the other person setup. The more intricate the traps, the more fun it was. There were times when we had 5-10 people over and played all day. Those of you that have done similar know how fun this kind of game is\/was, especially when you got someone good.\n \nSo after playing some smash, we decide to fuck around with the trap game. Per usual, I would be blindfolded first since it was Steve's house. I went in the room, tied the rag around my eyes and waited. After like 10 minutes, which was uncommonly long, Steve gave me the go ahead to come out. I felt for the door knob, opened the door and walked straight. Like anyone who\u2019s blindfolded and wary of the unexpected, I wailed my arms around and took awkward strides\u2026.until I stepped on something and heard a **CRUNCH**...followed by laughter. I ripped my blindfold off to see that I stepped on a red solo cup filled with a yellow liquid that soaked my sock.  \n \nSteve had filled up a few cups with his piss and scattered them on the floor as traps for me to step on. He thought it was hilarious, I thought it was a shitty trap and dick move (honestly, who would do that in their own house???). It was all the more reason to get him back with a trap he\u2019d never see coming ;). \n \nAs he waited in the room, I grabbed the power adaptor to the gamecube (you know, the one that has the bulky box thing) and leveled\/tied the cord to one of the blades on his ceiling fan. His fan spun incredibly fast and it wasn\u2019t too far off the ground either which made this the perfect trap he\u2019d never expect. After I fastened the wire, I turned the fan on high speed and watched as the power adaptor block swung around like a bastard. I called for Steve to come out and he emerged. \n \nSteve began to walk around the outside of the room, then back towards the middle and back again. The fan is kind of in the center so I was banking on him walking straight. After a minute of him being a pussy, he finally headed to the fan and then **BANG!**\n \nThe power adaptor nailed him perfectly on the side of the head and he fell down immediately. I laughed uncontrollably until I realized he wasn\u2019t moving. I shouted his name a few times, no response. I shook his body, no response. \n \nAfter a minute or two, I convinced myself that I killed my friend. Being terrified, I ran home without calling anyone and hid in my room all night.\n \nThe next morning, I was expecting to see the news report of a kid who died from massive head trauma caused by a swinging power adaptor. To my relief, I saw Steve in school with a bandage on his head. Apparently, he was just knocked out and woke up soon after I fled home. He wasn\u2019t too happy with me, neither were his parents when they came home and found out what happened.\n \nIt took a while for Steve to forgive me, especially for running home like a pussy instead of trying to help.\n \n**"},"doc_summ":{"0":"thinking of asking for a break from the relationship because losing respect","1":"I told my husband about the \"no plate\" trend and now he wants to replace all our plates with shovels.","2":"I haven't eaten ham in so long I forgot what ham looked like","3":"DH told Migraine Mim about baby, Mim posted about baby to fb, got caught lying, and DH finally shined up his spine.","4":"Touched a sandwich, may have inspired a psychopath.","5":"**: Girlfriend of 4 months is supposedly waving red flags all over the place (list above) but I'm either missing them or they aren't red flags at all and her friends\/my friends are being super weird\/judgemental.

He is stoned from the time he sits down to dinner until he falls asleep. I have nothing against weed, but there are work issues for me. Don't care if he smokes sometimes, but now it is EVERY time we are together and we can't even have a normal conversation. Recently, he's started complaining that sex is no good because we aren't \"in sync\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter last post, I discussed the weed and sex issue with BF. I told him that I feel like the one of the reasons we are not in sync sometimes is because he is stoned every time and way far off in his own little world. I sometimes feel he's more trying to act out a porn movie with a stranger instead of being engaged with me, and that he becomes too rough and impersonal. He seemed surprised that I had those concerns and said he'd not smoke up so that we could be in the same state of mind. Later, sex ensues. Immediately afterward - like 2 minutes - he had to \"go to the bathroom\". Of course, he came back reeking of weed. I get that he might have wanted to get high to go to sleep; however, I can't help but feel irritated that he got up and left the room immediately after he got what he wanted and got high again. And, although he doesn't need to ask my permission, it would have been nice if he had asked if I minded considering we had a lengthy conversation about it before going to bed. I went to sleep feeling used and second place to weed.\n\nI'm thinking of asking him for a break until my work matters get settled and we can agree on what amount of smoking is ok when we are together.  I'm hoping that we can start spending some time together with him sober again becasue it has been really sad to see him go from who he was to a stoned zombie every night. If you substitute any other substance into the context of this situation (alcohol, prescription meds, etc.) this would be labeled addiction. I realize that weed doesn't hold that stigma, yet I am sitting on the sofa every evening watching Cartoon Network with no hope of intelligent conversation.  I'm losing respect for him.\n\nAnyone have any experience with this? Can come to an agreement, or it is better to start looking for an exit from this relationship? I am fully willing to compromise, but he seems unable to put it aside for even one night.  Even if my situation allows me to participate again, I know I don't want it in my life on an everyday basis.\n\nOther info:\n\n1. We only spend 50% of our time together, so he also has  plenty of time to do this when I'm not around.  I don't understand why he has to be stoned the entire time that we are together.\n2. I am fairly positive that he was not hiding excessive use from me when we first met and that this habit has evolved from casual use a couple times a week to 3 or 4 times per night over the past six months. He is much different when he's stoned and not good at hiding it.\n3. The ease and convenience of using a vape pen with high THC may be contributing to the problem. He has no interest in switching products or methods - we have discussed this.","1":"This actually happened today, so maybe I broke the internet or something.\n\nMy husband and I went out to eat at one of our favorite restaurants tonight. As we were getting ready to order, another server on the floor approached ours to let her know that the restaurant was out of the rib special for the night. Our server had just left our table for the kitchen when we heard a plate crash on the floor in the back.\n\nWe both made the obligatory sad faces before my husband joked and said, \"Maybe they'll tell us that they are also out of plates for the night.\"\n\nI laughed, but added, \"You know that's a real trend, right? It's a hipster thing to serve food on non-plate items.\"\n\nAt first he thought I was joking, but I assured him that it was very real. So while we were waiting, I pulled up a few listicles that showed restaurant items being served on everything from miniature staircase sculptures to shoes.\n\nHowever, the one \"no plate\" item that caught his eye was the shovel. He was thoroughly amused by the idea of eating a meal served on a shovel and became obsessed with making it a reality. He started searching online for plate-sized shovels and made the worst jokes like, \"I sure can't wait to shovel all that food in my mouth.\" I'm genuinely concerned that I'm going to come home to a giant box of shovels.\n\nTL;DR I told my husband about the \"no plate\" trend and now he wants to replace all our plates with shovels.\n\nUpdate: Thanks to \/u\/possiblymakingshitup and \/u\/lmaes246, I now have a shovel-spoon flatware set on its way to be delivered by the end of the day.\n\nFinal update: If there's anyone out there still playing in Internetland, he LOVED the shovel silverware set and said he can't wait to use it. The mini shovels seem to have distracted him from using actual shovels as plates. :)","2":"I've recently started work at a cafe,  I'm new to the hospitality scene, and ngl it can be stressful. I mostly help out in the kitchen while they train me to be a good waiter. Also important to note,  I'm vegetarian, and have been for quite a while now,  but I haven't told any of the people I work with because I'm awkward I guess?  So today one of the guys was making a pizza, and he asked me to go into the fridge and get him some more ham, \"sure!  No worries\" I said how hard could that be?  So I walk around into The walk in fridge, up to where they keep all the meat and-\n\nOh god.  I don't know what ham looks like.  It's like,  that circle meat shit right? Fuck,  I spend 3 minutes looking for this god damn ham, now I'm sweating in a fridge for crying out loud,  where's the ham?  What does ham look like? Now I'm panicking, so I see some bacon. Tomato tomato right?  I run out and as he's working on the pizzas hold out the bacon to him \"I couldn't find the ham..  Is this what you meant? \" now he has this real confused look on his face and I realise not only did I not bring him ham,  I brought him FROZEN BACON.  ALL WRAPPED UP.  If this wasn't shameful enough,  another colleigue takes me back to the fridge to 'help me find the ham' and she walks in and grabs one of the 10 bags of that, long,  stippy meat, that was sitting at eye level the whole time,  giving me that long weird look you give to people who eat burgers separate from the Patty, before leaving me dumbfounded alone in the fridge.\n\nTl;dr I haven't eaten ham in so long I forgot what ham looked like ","3":"Migraine Mim and FIL texted DH asking how much time in advance he would need to request 3-4 days off work for them to visit. He told them any time this year would be difficult as we just found out we're moving as well as expecting baby #3 in September. They were of course excited and congratulated us but still would like to come visit. I shut it down and said not until she can apologize for the way she has treated us as adults, as a couple, and as parents as well as apologize for the way she has treated me in the past. \n\nAbout an hour later, DH received a Facebook message from someone we didn't know telling us congratulations on the pregnancy. Mim had posted in on her Facebook thinking that because we both had her blocked we wouldn't find out. He immediately texts FIL telling him to ask Mim to take it down as we weren't going to announce it yet and it wasn't her place to do so. He said he'd take care of it. Like naive little idiots, we believed it.\n\n14 hours and three congratulations later and the post is still up. Luckily one of her friends realized Mim was in the wrong and tattled on her letting us no it was still up. Pretty sure she had a justno of her own. DH texted FIL again but got Mim. Their conversation is as follows.\n\nDH: I keep getting congrats for the new baby from people on fb I asked nothi g to be posted and if there is a post take it down or don't bother coming if your not going to abide by my request\n\nMim: This is mom. I already removed it. So supposedly you don't use Facebook why does it bother you all so much that I mentioned a new addition to the family? I have abided by not posting pics....because even if that was okay....you don't share any with us anyways. I did not post who was having the baby as it could have been BILs. That is what really hurts is all of the family can share pics and talk about their grandchildren but We are not allowed. So please tell raerae to get her \"Friend\" off my list.\n\nDH: Don't lie to me I've got YOUR friend that is messaging ME about it still being up. HOW DARE YOU LIE TO ME. TAKE IT DOWN NOW!!!!!!\n\nMim: It is down and don't you Ever yell and swear at me again like a immature child. So please grow up and until you want to talk civilly about what is really bothering you we will be here. I'm dealing with enough bullshit right now but hey that doesn't seem to revolve around you unless it's You. Give our love to the boys and we pray everyone including baby stay healthy and happy.\n\nDH: I didn't swear at all. Nice to know you listen. Wow you sound like (narc aunt Mim hates) at this moment making you the victim when I asked a simple question about my family. So why don't you grow up and respect me as a parent about my family. And don't lie to me about anything when it comes to my family.\n\nThis is really the first time that DH has shown his shiny spine to his mom. This has been building for 5 years. Finally I feel like he's standing up for us as a family.\n\nI was gonna add her email and post sicking her friends on us but this is already getting too long so I'll probably post it separately.\n\nTL;DR: DH told Migraine Mim about baby, Mim posted about baby to fb, got caught lying, and DH finally shined up his spine.","4":"Obligatory, \"it happened a few years ago\", not today. \n\nI started the school year late due to a surgery, so I was unfamiliar with all the new kids at the start of term. On my first day back, I hit it off with this Asian kid who was really nice, but for some reason everyone else thought I was stupid befriending him. \n\nDuring lunch break, we're getting along well when he announces to the room that he's going to throw something in the bin, and that no one touch his sandwich. When someone makes a demand like that, a good rule of thumb is to follow it, but that's not what I did. As he went to the bin, I thought it was a good idea to *fucking touch the goddamn sandwich*. \n\nWhat happened next still blows my mind. In the most absurd act of rage I've ever seen, he charges towards me, socks me in the face, takes his sandwich back, lifts his chair up while tears and spittle stream down his face, and proceeds to throw it at the glass window. He then swipes clean the teachers desk, sending paper and electronics flying, all while yelling something unintelligible. \n\nAfter the show of queer dominance, I noped the fuck out of there. \n\nTurns out that kid had ADHD, was a hygiene freak, had anger management issues and suffered from depression and went into drugs a few years after he was expelled. I don't want to think that I started it all by touching his fucking sandwich. \n\nTL;DR: Touched a sandwich, may have inspired a psychopath. \n\nEdit: I understand that ADHD was not the root cause of it. He apparently had numerous issues alongside ADHD, but he was unstable. I did end up stopping him from jumping off the 5th floor when he got rejected by the hottest girl in the year, so I guess we're even...?\n\nEdit 2: A few of you wanted more stories of \"Ryan\", so here you go:\n\n* Ryan called his homeroom teacher a 'biatch'. He was fond of the word, and since this was 7th grade, the teacher let him off telling him not to use that word with adults.\n\n* In a music class, the teacher paired us such that each pair had one person good at playing the instrument (I think it was a small clarinet), and another who wasn't as skilled. Unknowingly, she paired Ryan with another ADHD kid he absolutely detested, Josh. Josh was really good at playing the instrument, and tuned out Ryan when he asked to share the clarinet, which absolutely pissed him off. He dug through his bag and stabbed Josh in the forearm with a pair of scissors, drawing blood and a piercing scream from Josh. Everyone stopped playing and saw the blood trailing down from Josh's arm. The teacher took one look and sent for help. Josh took a few days off school, and had to make sure he didn't get infected from the scissors. Ryan was suspended for two weeks and was sent to anger management again. Oh, and he called the teacher a 'biatch'.\n\n* A kid made a \"yo mamma\" joke about Ryan, and the hottest girl in the year rejected him, which I guess was too much for Ryan. He decided to jump off the fifth floor five minutes before homeroom, when literally the whole school was going to class. So it was half our class outside telling him to get the fuck down while the entire floor just watched. He got down, and this other kid and I got a cheap medal and a phone call home due to \"excellent counseling in a time of crisis\". Ryan was suspended for an indeterminate amount of time while the school got their shit together and decided to move him to another school.\n\nI'm so glad this country has solid gun control.","5":"I\u2019ve known my current GF for about a year. We met through friends and were casual acquaintances. She was dating someone sort of on\/off and he put an end to it just before Christmas of last year. We stayed casual acquaintances until this summer and then began seeing each other. Official for four months. \n\nFriends have commented on her \u201codd habits\u201d that have ruined relationships in the past. At drinks, a few of my friends warned me. That was followed-up by one of girlfriends asking me to give her an honest chance. \n\nFrom the outside, she looks completely, totally, normal. She\u2019s amazing looking, well poised and just a really great sociable person. When we\u2019re alone, she\u2019s a lot more confessional about her social anxiety, esp. worried about hurting people\u2019s feelings and worried she\u2019s committed some transgressions. All things I\u2019ve dealt with in a relationship before. She has mild\/moderate OCD which she gets therapy for.  \n\nI guess her odd behavior or habit is that she has this thing where she likes to play with my hair, for hours on end. We can watch a movie with her playing with my hair. She keeps asking if it bothers me or if I am annoyed. It neither bothers nor annoys me. \n\nI finally asked my friends to clarify and they went through a litany of \u201cweird\u201d things. She does every single one of them.\n \n* She does talk to her cats; \n\n* She is fastidious with folding clothes (it\u2019s impressive to watch); \n\n* She gets flustered easily in social situations and begins to profusely sweat; \n\n* She has an odd habit of sleeping with her arm under her SO\/ my clothes; \n\n* She gets very \u201ccomfortable\u201d around her SOs pretty quickly; \n\n* She\u2019s very direct about how she envisions her future; \n\n* She has a bit of a \u201cwild\u201d past; \n\n* She talks to herself (she\u2019ll do it when she doesn\u2019t think anyone is around\/notices); \n\n* She orders\/alphabetizes everything and will fix it if it gets out of order; \n\n* Her fridge is all put into special containers and ordered by categories  (sauces in sauce section, meats in meats, leftovers with leftovers);\n\n* She brushes her teeth ~3 or 4 times a day; \n\n* She can be very forthright: she\u2019ll ask (rhetorically) if she has bad BO then smell her pits, can\u2019t decide and then ask me. \n\nNone of this strikes me as critically odd\/Red Flag, but everyone seems to think I'm blind to it..... Am I? Am I missing flags here?\n\nI met her parents and they\u2019re lovely people who seemed a bit\u2026 like maybe I was going to dump her, too. They were very lovely but guarded, made sure I knew she was a really great girl, etc. \n\nAm I totally off the wall or are my\/her friends just conjuring crap in their minds? \n\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 4 months is supposedly waving red flags all over the place (list above) but I'm either missing them or they aren't red flags at all and her friends\/my friends are being super weird\/judgemental. Now I'm doubting myself. ","6":"I met this guy we\u2019ll call \u201cJustin\u201d about a year ago. We run in the same arts scene, and he was friends with my SO so I was friendly with him at first. After getting to know him a bit better, I started picking up on a ton of red flags that I really try to avoid in friendships and men in general. He\u2019s superficially charming, but he\u2019s got a fragile ego, and short temper. He\u2019s pushy, confrontational, and misogynistic. On top of that, he\u2019s *sincerely* not very good at what we do, and he doesn\u2019t take constructive criticism well. He\u2019s burned some bridges, and several people have spoken to him about his lack of professionalism. I hope I\u2019m not coming across as really bitchy here, but I\u2019ve dealt with a ton of people like him in my career, and I\u2019m out of patience. \n\nI was able to maintain a friendly relationship with him for a while, but he has slowly pushed me into the \u201cthis guy makes my skin crawl\u201d territory. The first time I ran into him at a show without my SO he said \u201cwhere\u2019s so-and-so? I guess this means I can hit on you now!\u201d I brushed it off as a bad joke at the time, but seriously he\u2019s a grown-ass man who should know better than that at this point. There\u2019s a lot of grey area in my industry, but it\u2019s still my job and there\u2019s so many layers of disrespect there.\n\nAnother time at a party I was catching up with an old friend of mine from out of town in the hallway, away from the action, where we very obviously wanted privacy. \u201cJustin\u201d waltzes over and cuts me off to say \u201cI just have to interrupt, because your friend here is so beautiful.\u201d Again, I chalked it up to bad game, but this time I said something about it. I tried to have a sincere conversation with him about how his actions make me and other women feel, and he got extremely defensive. He said he can\u2019t help but hit on pretty girls all the time, because he\u2019s \u201cjust a caveman\u201d and that\u2019s how he\u2019s wired. There was no getting through to him.\n\nI don\u2019t want to write a novel here, but I\u2019ve been trying to keep my distance from him for a while. I\u2019ll say a polite hello when we run into each other, but I don\u2019t engage him in conversation. I really don\u2019t see a reason I should have to interact with him beyond that, but now it seems my coldness is pissing him off. For the past two weeks or so, he keeps trying to \u201chave a chat\u201d with me, but the way he\u2019s going about it makes me uncomfortable. First, he cornered me at a show and tried to invite himself over to my apartment. He said \u201cyou\u2019re free in the afternoons, right? I can just swing by.\u201d Most recently, he chased me out of a show shouting my name and calling me rude. He frightens me, and the thought of having to say that to his face frightens me even more. Should I try sending him a message? What can I say that won\u2019t just make things worse?\n\nTL;DR: a colleague I dislike and feel unsafe around isn\u2019t taking the hint that I want space. How do I enforce my boundaries?","7":"First time poster here. This was one of the scariest days of my life.\n\nSome needed info: This one's from way back to my high-school years. I was 3rd year when this happened. My school is an old private school which is literally located smacked in the middle of a jungle. It takes literally 15-20 minute drive to the town.\n\nWe all have had those Science projects right? So on my 3rd year of high-school, I decided to do something ambitious. It was pretty much an attempt to collect native plants from my area and see if they have any potential as a bio-fuel source. I also wanted to work alone because I just wanted to.\n\nInitially, everything was going smoothly as according to plan. My proposal was approved, the school gave me permission to use the lab after class hours, I had access to some chemicals that were hard to come-by, and I got help with collecting the different plant samples.\n\nSo pretty much, the process involves me \"extracting\" any fuel components from plant matter using a chemical called N-HEXANE. It pretty much acts as a co-solvent. To spare you any of the rather deeper details, it involved usage heat while mixing in the N-HEXANE. My school's chem lab was a separate building from the main campus.\n\nMy first few weeks were great. Some plants barely produced anything while there were some promising ones. On a chill Tuesday afternoon though, I attempted to continue my project groggy and lacking some sleep. Spent the night before playing Left 4 Dead and Civ 4 with friends. That was were I made my first mistake. I proceeded to do the ritual cleaning of equipment, setting up the distillation stuff (you know, the works), and preparing the plant samples.\n\nEverything was going fine up until the point I needed to add the N-HEXANE to the plant now crushed plant mass. The plant mass was inside a flask that was being heated over a bunsen burner. Stupid sleepy me forgot to prepare the N-HEXANE which was kept nicely in chilled cabinet\/refrigerator thingy, so I immediately rushed to grab it, pour a few ml to a small beaker, and pour it into the flask. \n\nThat's were I made my second mistake. What happens when you have a heated piece of glass that gets subjected to something cold? Yup. It shatters. And boy did it shatter like the 4th of fucking July. The moment the glass broke, the plant mass and the N-HEXANE immediately caught fire. Pieces of glass hit dug into my skin with some hitting sinking deep into my face. Thankfully I had goggles so my eyes were spared. That wasn't the worst part though. The fire that erupted outward had burnt my hair and areas of my face. I fell down to the ground and the whole table was on fire.\n\nI tried to quickly get up by grabbing onto the table and pulling myself up. Third mistake. There was shattered glass on the table and it cut through my glove and straight into my right hand. I panicked like there was no tomorrow and in the process, I hit the bunsen burner and it disconnects the rubber hose from it. Fire quickly jumped onto the streaming gas. The main pipes that supplied gas started bursting with fire. That's when I knew I was really fucked. I just got down and took cover under the cement lab table I was working on and prayed it'd be alright when suddenly- I heard a loud bang and the lab shook.\n\nI took a few moments before slowly getting up. The school's fire alarm was roaring. I was delirious and in pain. There was huge hole in the very back of the lab. Fire, glass, and rubble was everywhere. Took all my focus just to get out of the building and when I got out, there were security guards all over the place. \n\nSpent the next few weeks recovering and explaining to the school administration what the hell just happened. Thankfully, my family didn't have to pay too much for the damages and all I got was detention. Ended up changing projects to something related to composting and lemons.\n\nTL;DR I shattered a vial of bio-fuel over a roaring Bunsen Burner. It explodes in my face and somehow causes the fire to travel up and blow the main gas tank outside the lab.","8":"[First post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/3yhvlz\/me_25m_with_my_ex_25f_of_3_months_i_want_her_out\/)\n\nSo, after evaluating all the advice from fellow redditors as well as my wise step-father, I decided to lay down the law:\n\n* I'm giving her until the end of January (so 1 month) to be moved out.\n* I'm keeping the new car and not going to hassle with trying to lease it to her.  I'm going to pull all my fancy audio equipment out of my otherwise worthless rustbucket that I've been driving and just give that to her since it's paid off and I don't want to pay insurance on two cars anyways.\n* I remembered that she is still on my cellphone plan; she will either get her own plan or go back on her mother's.  For now, her data is turned off because I got a notice from the carrier that she used 5gb out of the shared 6gb only halfway through the billing cycle (that's what reminded me about the phone lol).\n\nThe conversation conveniently started a few minutes after I turned off her phone's data, because apparently her phone was failing to authenticate to my wifi.  I took that opportunity to switch her over to my segregated guest network (yay, now I can clean up some of the firewall rules I built before because I didn't feel like talking to her about switching to my guest network . . . hell, I wouldn't put it past myself to have blocked her from getting on the main SSID specifically so this would happen, but I honestly don't remember doing that).  I'll admit I felt a little bad about instantly assuming she was purposefully using the data and shutting it off, but I didn't go back on that decision and she didn't ask me too.\n\nI felt like I had to be a bit of a dick about to the point across that her problems are *hers* and I shouldn't be responsible for them anymore.  She complained again about not having anywhere to go, so I told her exactly what several other people had pointed out:  \"I'm pretty sure you do; they just aren't as nice.\"\n\nShe huffed and told me to call her brother and convince her to share his room, but I stood my ground and told her that she has to figure that out on her own.  She huffed some more but realized that she doesn't have much of an argument here.\n\nThen she thought the conversation was over and started to walk away, but I told her we needed to talk about the car too.  She was not happy at all when I said that we're going to switch the cars around and I'm essentially going to give her a functioning (albeit probably barely) vehicle for free.  She expressed concern about getting the short end of the stick there because she is going from getting to drive a new car for free to driving a rustbucket for free (and actually owning it and having to pay insurance).  Well, you know what's worse than driving a rustbucket?  Driving nothing.  So take what you can get, because I'm being really generous just giving away a car that I could keep around as a spare or get some cash from a junkyard for if I wanted to.\n\nShe's still upset because she really wanted to the new car and really thought she'd be able to lease it and make payment, but I explained to her that I'm not willing to remain liable for her driving when we aren't even going to be living together.  Not to mention the fact that I don't trust her to make timely and full payments on anything ever.  I'm just going to eat the loss on the debt that I foolishly absorbed from her worthless trade-in.  I gotta live with the consequences of my mistakes as well I guess.\n\nI truly hate that Kia Soul, but I guess I'll have to get used to it.  Maybe it will be better if I get some blindspot mirrors and upgrade the stereo (hopefully reusing most of what I already bought for the old Cavalier).\n   \n**tl;dr**: I'm taking control of my life again and kicking out a leech.  Thanks so much to everybody who replied to my first post!\n\n**PS**: And thanks to the person who suggested that I check out this sub in the first place.  If you're reading this, you know who you are. ;)  You're awesome!\n\nedit:  Wow, wasn't expecting this to get so much attention.

The advice was overwhelmingly along the lines of \"this is a major problem and will not go away\" - and I agreed with it at the time. However, after posting, I decided to wait a bit just to see how things went because I really liked the guy.\n\nThere are a couple of things that affected his behaviour that I didn't really understand before:\n\n* He is not fulfilled by his work, and so any time not spent in work is really important to him and he wants to make the most of it\n\n* Most of his close friends are big drinkers, and he was trying to cut back. This meant that he was not seeing his friends as often as all they do is go out on the weekend together. \n\nThese two things together meant that he was alone a lot more than he used to be and he was feeling frustrated in general. So here's what has happened since:\n\nOver the summer, I wasn't in classes anymore and we spent a lot of time together. This sort of goes against intuition, as I thought more time apart would be better. But there are a lot of days when I don't feel like doing anything, so if he wanted to spend time with me, that meant that he had to come up with something to do while I was reading or sewing or doing whatever on my own. He got comfortable with watching something or reading something while I was sitting there doing my own thing.\n\nHe figured out how to hang out with his friends without making it a big drinking night. They started going out to dinner once in a while. He would go out with them occasionally and just not drink as much and go home early. I think this really helped him not feel so alone.\n\nHe came to terms with how unfulfilling his job is and he's currently working to fix that. A few months ago, we started having some honest conversations about what he really wanted to do, and he was trying to figure that out for a while. Well now he has a solid plan of getting to that new career, and while it will take some time, he gets so excited just talking about it. I think this has helped tremendously.\n\nThanks to everyone who commented. I think everyone was exactly right that it was a pretty major problem, which is why I posted. I appreciate everyone telling me that though. Sometimes you need to hear that. I'm glad I gave it a chance to fix itself though. I honestly couldn't be happier in my relationship than I am now.\n\ntl;dr: boyfriend and I are still together, he's figured out to be alone, things are great.","10":"So my ILs are very religious, and don't want us to live together. They gave us a car as an early bday present and two weeks later told us it was on the condition we don't live together first... we are saving up for a new one. \n\nAnyway, we haven't planned to move in together until FH has a job (I don't make much and would have difficulty covering both of us) or we get married (and accumulate gift money) so he is at home. ILs bought a new house and are trying to sell their old house. FBIL (younger) is going to move in to the new house while the parents live in the old house as they try to sell. FH was planning to move into the new house until we get married in August. It's a really nice house! \n\nFH and BIL were discussing setting up the internet at the new house and how they would divide housework and cooking when House Kitty struck. She told FH that he had to stay at the old house with his parents until the house was sold \"In case he needed help\". He is a grown as man, but apparently he needs more help than his little brother!? \n\nHe told her he would move into the new house but would be able to drive back if House Kitty needed any help, but she got angry and said \"Why would I ask for your help? You spend all your time with Pokedoob, you're not around to help. \nis it so wrong for me to ask you to stay with us? Your place is not at the new house.\" Yea lady, that's weird. \n\nGood Ol' FH told her that, if his place wasn't at the new house, he may as well just move straight in with me because it would be more efficient, and walked out, so I don't know how she reacted. \n\nLater on, when discussing moving furniture, FMIL ask FH if he wanted a new bed in his room. He said it's didn't matter because he wouldn't be there long. House Kitty replied \"yes, I know you will only be there 2-3years but that's enough time to justify a new bed\". We are getting married IN AUGUST!!! In under 6 months!!!\n\nHe told her this and said that if she wanted a new guest bed then to go for it, but he is fine with the guest bed until August. House Kitty replied \"but you don't want to have to sleep In pokedoobs old bed and sleep poorly. We will get you a new bed and you can stay here for a bit longer. You are too young to have a bad sleep\". Um my bed was $6000 and is EXTREMELY comfortable, and no, he isn't going to decide to post pone the wedding because of a bed! \n\nArgh, I know she is just having some problems letting him go, but it's getting kind of ridiculous! FH thought it was so stupid he didn't even want to tell me at first because he knew I would rage! \n\nTl;dr - House Kitty DOES NOT want FH to leave home!","11":"I wanted to post this for two reasons. \n1. I feel like there is misinformation circulating about IUDs and wanted to share my experience in case it is helpful to someone else. \n2. I am honestly sick and tired of the often-encountered medical agenda to push hormonal birth control are young women without thoroughly reviewing possible side effects. \n\nI had Skyla (the smallest Progestin IUD) inserted 3 weeks ago.  About 10 days after insertion I noticed a sudden and drastic mood change.  The first bout of this lasted three days where I was irritable, very easily moved to cry and had an all around low mood.  I have been a bit up and down since then, but have noted having \"bad days\" about 2 out of 3 days where before I would have a \"bad day\" like this maybe once a month.  My boyfriend also noticed this sudden and drastic change.  I have also felt fatigued, despite getting 8-9 hours of sleep each night.  It's important to note that there have been no significant stressors or changes in my life during this time that might otherwise account for this change. \n\nMood and energy levels can easily be discounted, but my boobs have literally quadrupled in size since beginning this BC just a few weeks ago.  My bras no longer fit, they are very sore, and feel so heavy.  I have always been rather small chested, which I actually like, and now feel like I have a full chest.  My boyfriend has noticed this as well. \n\nToday, I went to the doctor to have the IUD removed.  I am still shaking because of the absolute condescension, pressure, and shame that I was met with before I was able to get the IUD removed.  The physician told me that my mood could not be affected by this BC, and it must have been something else (despite me having no mood issues in the past several years and having a history of BC-induced mood changes in my early 20's).  She told me my breast enlargement was not \"objective\" and implied it was either in my head or caused by something else (despite me never having breasts this large save when I waist college and on another hormonal BC).  She asked me repeatedly how I planned on avoiding pregnancy and reiterated that this was the best method for doing so.  \n\nI told her that I had gone into the IUD with major concerns about hormonal BC, but was convinced by gyro who told me it was a very small amount that would be localized to my uterus.  That after witnessing these changes I can tell it is not localized to my uterus, and I do not want body influenced by outside hormones.  At this point (since this was a university health center), she asked me what I was studying with a condescending tone that implied I had no understanding of how these medications work.  I look very young but am actually a professor with a PhD in Health Psychology.  However, I felt too ashamed to say this given the tone of the conversation and simply said I had already graduated with a degree in psychology.  She then told me birth control had been well studied for 50 years and the evidence is in, it is safe.  I do not disagree that this may be \"safe\" for most people, but I have had several negative experiences that lead me to believe it is not something I want in my body.  Finally, as a last ditch effort, she said \"Ok, I will remove it.  It is just such a shame because they are so expensive.\"  \n\nI am leaving out several parts because I feel like this is already too long, but I am hoping to convey how condescending and pressured this entire experience was.  I felt as though my doctor did not listen to me about my own body, my own values, and my own experiences.  Although research done by the pharmaceutical companies may say otherwise, I know myself and my body and what effects this medication had on me.  There's already been a post about this today, but LISTEN TO YOURSELF.  And don't be afraid to advocate for what you want.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far :) \n\nTL;DR: I had negative, systemic type side effects from Skyla IUD.  My doctor patronized and subtly shamed me before agreeing to remove the device.  ","12":"i purchased a lake house in the same town as my somewhat estranged family about 5 years ago... i'd never had a relationship with my cousin prior to this (me growing up out state) and it seemed like a great opportunity to rekindle with my relatives and enjoy the lake\/nature.  \n\nThe lake is a very popular lake, and my cousin had a slip at the marina + pontoon before i moved.. A slip is about $3k a year... He runs a lawn service and doesn't have a lot of money, so we made a deal where he could dock his boat at my dock in exchange for taking care of the garden.  \n\nOver the years, he mows about 10 times a summer and that's it.. he does a pretty poor job, running over dog toys, not edging etc..\nHe lets family and friends use his boat, so there's people coming and going every day.. There's been a couple situations where his friends left the gate open and my dog got out (3x last summer)..\n\nI feel I have no privacy, and the deal isn't really beneficial to me.. My cousin is a known 'hot head' and could stop talking to me if i end it.... It would definitely put a strain on our relationship.  \n\nWhat do I do? How can i stop our agreement without hurting our relationship? I have plenty of other minor grievences, but he's not the type to fix them.. I would like to stop him docking his boat over the summer and find someone else to do the lawn work.  \n\n**tl;dr** i helped out my cousin with an exchange of services, the deal has soured for me and i want out but in a way that doesn't destroy the relationship\n\n**edit:** Thanks everyone for the great advice.  Per the majority of suggestions my plan is to talk to him ASAP and let him know that I need to cancel the arrangement next year and try to leave the conversation at that.. If he insists on me giving a reason I'lll use the loss of privacy, my desire to refurb the dock and finally the insurance \/ increased liability it causes.","13":"So first of all, throwaway because I'm pretty sure best friend uses reddit.\n\nBackground:\nI began dating my fiance, who we'll call M, 7 years ago, when she was 20 and I was 21. At the time M was roommates with her best friend, R, and R's boyfriend of 10 years (they'd literally been \"dating\" since they were 10) B. \n\nI immediately became close with B. We shared lots of hobbies, video game favorites, etc... M, B, R and myself all became close friends. \n5 years ago, B was diagnosed with late stage cancer. Things hit him hard and quick and by the end of the year he was gone. This crushed both M and myself, but obviously no one more then R. \n\nFrom that point on, R began to spiral. She managed to cling on to her GPA and maintain her masters program for a bit, but didn't stick it out for long because of her massive depression and eventual alcoholism. R began therapy and all of our friend group was there for her. M and myself went numerous times to her house (which was bought for her by her parents thank god) because she called us at all hours of the night. \n\nOver the years, R has not gotten better. She has lost jobs and friends. Luckily she has an inheritance from her grandmother that will last her a long time. But even her parents have stopped talking to her and now her only friend is M, and by extension, me. \n\nMy fiance dedicates so much time to making sure R is okay. R has become a hardcore, nonfunctional alcoholic. She does nothing for herself. M stocks her fridge every week to make sure she has food (but somehow R has time to get alcohol). Her phone is on at all hours of the night because R calls her from strange and dangerous places needing to be picked up. A few times we have sat vigil in the ICU. \n\nPlease don't get me wrong. I love M and I love her dedication to her friend. But we have not been on a vacation since B died because R might need her. M has missed so many days of work because of R. R ruined our engagement party by getting too drunk and crying about her own lost love... and M drove her home instead of staying with me. \n\nIt's gotten to the point where I think I need to put my foot down. I'm not trying to make M cut off R, just set healthy boundaries of any friendship. Anytime I bring this up M gets defensive. I understand why. But I can't deal with it anymore and I don't think M can either.\n\nBasically I'm asking for advice about talking to M in a constructive manner. I'm trying to come from a place of compassion for R and not resentment. I just want what's best and healthiest from my fiance. Any advice is welcome \n\nTldr- fiance has spent too much time being held back by alcoholic best friend. Need help showing her this.","14":"\n\nX post from relationships\n\nI went to college for computer engineering, and got a job in the industry afterwards. In college, my internships, and my job, I've dealt with sexual harassment and I've had to get tough with people, telling them to stay the fuck away when I get the first whiff of sketchiness.\n\nEvery time I've gotten a creepy text or instant message from another student or co worker, I've screenshotted it and backed it up in google drive just in case it escalates. That's helped me a few times, when someone started to follow me around in college, and when someone took things so far at work that I decided to go to HR. I don't report most of the shit though, I don't want it to look bad like I'm always running to HR.\n\nLast night, I got really drunk with my friend because I had a day off planned for today. I went home in a kinda bad mood because we'd been talking about how she was going through similar shit at work. I was in a \"fuck it all\" mood, and I uploaded my whole folder of screenshotted text messages to Facebook and Instagram, with the caption \"Phone &amp; Inbox of a female computer engineer.\" And tagged all the men who had sent me messages, whose social media I could find.\n\nSome of the highlights were...\n\nA bunch of married men hitting on me, and me replying \"dude you're married\" or something along those lines.\n\nSome guys asking me out and then taking rejection badly.\n\nSome guys who would text me repeatedly even though I'd just replied \"Don't contact me, other than for work purposes\"\n\nSexually explicit messages, or messages commenting on my appearance out of the blue.\n\nOverall, just messages from people ignoring my wishes to be left alone.\n\nThis morning, I woke up to my phone blowing up. (I had planned to take a vacation day off work today). A lot of the guys I'd tagged in my social media posts had contacted me demanding or pleading that I remove the posts. Most everyone had untagged themselves.\n\nThe Facebook post had gotten some attention from my friends, but my two Instagram posts (I had to make 2 to fit all the photos) had blown up. I had a lot of new followers, a lot of strangers commenting on my post, mostly supportive.\n\nI also had a email from HR at work asking me to meet with them first thing Monday morning. I replied to say that I would. I don't know what to expect there at all. I have not replied to any other messages about my posts.\n\nI need some advice. Should I speak to the guys who texted me about the posts? Some are very angry with me because they are married and their wives found out. I'm thinking it's safest to not. Should I leave the posts up, or remove them? Or wait to see how things go with HR before I decide? Should I be worried for my safety? I feel a little nervous but I don't know if I'm overreacting.\n\nTLDR - I posted an album on social media, a collection of creepy texts I have gotten from men in my field of study and work","15":"I'm sure this or some variant of this story has been posted before, but I did my best to search and didn't come up with anything quite close enough.\n\nMy fiance and I are both from different states, and it just so happens that a handful of his high school classmates and friends have also ended up in the area. We have a group of six or seven of us that hang out on the regular, and this includes a few of my own friends from undergrad (I went to college in the area). \n\nOne girl from his hometown, \"Anna,\" isn't someone he was ever close with while he was in high school, but we've hung out with her and her husband \"John,\" since they moved here a year or so ago. Anna has tried really, really hard with me. She wants to be friends, so I try to reciprocate this, but the issue is that no one can stand her husband.\n\nHe isn't a mean guy, but he is arrogant and irritating. He wants to tell everyone how to live their lives, criticizes people if they say they are \"proud of their heritage,\" criticizes people for getting married before their wedding day, tries to explain how computers work to electrical engineers (he just took a six-week IT course), is generally inflammatory, and is a textbook example of the Dunning Kruger effect.\n\nI don't believe my friend group is being hypersensitive here, as I know through the grapevine (and through Anna herself) that most people from their hometown had the same issue with John. I have friends in this group who rarely have anything negative to say about anyone, and even they have expressed a desire to never be around John.\n\nSo here's the issue. My group plans things a lot of get togethers and excursions, and while I'd like to include Anna, no one is on board if John is going to be there. This is extra hard when you consider that most of these people in my group are from the same small town as Anna and John, so it's not like she has never met them. I've managed to just hang out with her one on one of late, but I really don't like worrying that someone is going to post about our get-togethers on social media where Anna could find out that we didn't invite her and John, and I know micromanaging everyone's social media posts isn't the answer either.\n\nI know Anna is somewhat aware of the effect John has on people, as she's said things to the effect of, \"oh I wouldn't blame anyone for not wanting to be around John.\" We all have theories about why she's with someone like him, but anyway... I'm not sure how to handle this. \n\nMy current plan is just to keep going on as is, and if she ever asks about it I'll be honest, but I don't know if that's the right move. Has anyone else dealt with this? How'd you handle it, and would you do anything differently?\n\nTl;Dr, no one (including myself) wants to be around my friend's husband and I feel like I have to hide all of my social events from her as a result. What do I do?\n\nEdit: original post didn't make it clear that I also do not like John, and have no interest in forcing myself or anyone else to be around him.","16":"I have a best friend \"Kimberly\" that I've known since pre-school. Inseparable ever since, she's like the sister I've never had, etc. You get the picture. \n\nAnyways Kimberly has had a few boyfriends over the years, but her first serious one, first love, was Kyle. They met senior year in college. They were nutso crazy about each other. I became friends with Kyle by association, he's a pretty good dude, and I liked him for my friend. They were together for almost two years when Kimberly broke up with him. \n\nIt wasn't over anything scandalous or terrible, it was just basic but insurmountable incompatibility. (One wants kids, the other is childfree and they both have VERY different sex drives). \n\nEven though Kimberly initiated the breakup, she was absolutely crushed and devastated. She had wanted to marry Kyle (and he wanted to marry her), but realized it would never work in the long run, and better to end it now then drag it out for years or get married and then get divorced.\n\nI was proud of her but I hurt right along with her. It was just a sad and shitty situation because both of them are good people, just not right for each other. It messed her up bad and took her a very long time to recover from. \n\nAlmost a year later, Kimberly cautiously decided to go on a date with a guy she met at her rock climbing gym. They hit it off, sparks flew and they have now been dating almost 3 months. I am very happy for my friend, I haven't met her new bf yet but he seems to be very good for her, it's the first time since the breakup that I've seen her truly happy and smiling again and I thought at long last she was finally over Kyle.\n\nUntil 3 days ago. We were having a girls night, drinking wine, watching horrible chick flicks, playing Mario Kart and having lots of girl talk. And she mentions (after a couple glasses) how even though she is super happy with her new bf she just can't stop logging into Kyle's facebook account.\n\nI was like....????. What are you talking about? Kimberly says she still has Kyle's facebook password and she has been logging into his facebook (I can't remember if they blocked each other or just unfriended each other after the breakup) for a year sometimes to see what he's up to.\n\nI immediately told her what she's doing is super shady and creepy for one, and two is  kind of  disloyal to her current bf. \nKimberly got kind of defensive and said she didn't agree, that it's harmless and she just wanted to see what is going on with Kyle sometimes without having to talk to him directly. She also said that in the beginning she was logging in way too much (almost daily) but over time she has slowly scaled back and ever since she met her bf she only logs in a few times a month. \n\nI told her it's still wrong and she needs to stop it now. How would she feel if her bf was logging in to his ex's social media? How would she feel if Kyle was logging in to hers. She got flippant and said she wouldn't care and speaking of which, why did I care so much? Maybe I should mind my own business. \n\nNight was kind of ruined after that, and because Kimberly had been drinking I told her she could crash on my couch but I was going to bed. She left in the morning. \n\nSo here it is, three days later and I'm wondering what to do. I'm actually still friends with Kyle on Facebook. And I've been thinking of sending him a PM saying something about this. I haven't really figured out the right words though. On the other hand...I feel disloyal to Kimberly for going behind her back and talking to her ex and ratting her out. \n\nPlus I'm worried that Kyle will rat ME out to Kimberly and our friendship will be jeopardized. It's the last thing I want. Or that Kyle will be weirded out by me or not believe me. We haven't really talked since the breakup, just the occasional \"like\" on some of each others statuses and pics. I'm wondering if this is really even any of my business and if I should just stay out of it altogether and that I'm completely out of line to say anything. \n\n**TL;DR Found out my bff sometimes still \"hacks\" into her ex boyfriends facebook account. Called her for being shady, she sees nothing wrong with it, now debating saying something to the ex but wondering if I'm being a bad friend or sticking my nose in something that is totally not my business**","17":"I just want to say English isn't my first language so excuse any mistakes.\n\nSo my gf and I became a couple during college and we were a very happy couple all the 3 years we were together.We helped each other through so much and are much better people because of each other.\n\nRecently she took up a fellowship programme and met a guy there that she claims was just an infatuation. But it got to a point where I felt she was emotionally cheating on me. So when i confronted her about it, she said that she was suddenly freaked out about how serious we had gotten and that she wished she could have experiences with other men(we've both not been in relationships or even had flings before). I took it pretty badly but I managed to get myself together and accept the situation. She insisted we remained friends and even encouraged me to go to and \"try other women\".\n\nOver the next few weeks she would mention a couple of her experiences and then go on to tell me that she realised that I was right for her all along and she just did the whole thing because she suddenly felt claustrophobic in the relationship. \n\nShe now says she doesn't want to be with anyone else and wants to get back together. She's really nice to me and she seems genuinely sorry and willing to fix things.She says I'm even allowed a few flings to compensate for everything. Is this even right? Im confused. What do I do?\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Gf of 3 years broke up to \"try other guys\". Tried other guys, now wants to get back. What do i do?","18":"This didn't happen to me but to my uncle. Two months ago my uncle was driving over the streets of north jakarta when he saw a woman push her own daughter right in the path of his car. Luckily he stopped just in time. His car in question (Honda HRV Mugen) was pretty big so getting hit by it could really result in a bad outcome. My uncle ran out and checked on the girl and the woman stormed right up to him and said\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEM: WHY DIDN'T YOU KEEP DRIVING???\n\nUncle: WHAT? WHAT SORT OF MOTHER PUSHES HER OWN DAUGHTER IN FRONT OF A ONCOMING CAR?????!?!?!\n\nEM: WELL DUHHH, WE NEED THE MONEY FROM HER HEALTH INSURANCE, IT;S REALLY GOOD\n\nUncle: WHAT SORT OF MOTHER DOES THAT, YOU KNOW SHE COULD'VE BEEN KILLED RIGHT?\n\nEM: I KNOW AND I DON;T CARE!!!!!! I NEED MONEY FOR THE BILLS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe Entitled mother then went straight to my uncles car and tried to get in but my uncle locked it.\n\nEM: LET ME IN THIS CAR NOW!!!!!\n\nUncle: NO, I'M CALLING THE POLICE!!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy uncle called the police and they came in no time as the police station is only 3 minutes away. EM screamed\n\nEM: THAT MAN TRIED TO KILL MY DAUGHTER, I WANT HIM ARRESTED!!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe police then tackled my uncle to the ground and arrested him, EM was making a whole sob story about how he stole her car (my uncles) and tried to run over em;s daughter. The police went to talk to my uncle and that;s when he said\n\nUncle: Officer please you have to believe me, she pushed her own daughter in front of my car, I have dash cam, look at it.\n\nThe police agreed and looked over the footage, while em went pale.\n\nP: it seems it;s true, EM Your under arrest for child endangerment, attempted murder and attempted fraud (dash cam had sound and recorded EM's intentions)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy uncle was released and the mom was put in the cop car, The police asked if he wants to press charges and he agreed. three weeks later the court came and EM was guilty for all charges as well as kidnapping because her \"daughter\" was actually the daughter of a rich friend of hers. she got sentenced for 15 years and deportation (she's from malaysia)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(sorry if this is short, my uncle literally just told me just now while i was eating pizza)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr: woman shoves \"daughter\" Into oncoming traffic for her health insurance, get's caught in her plans, arrested and deported","19":"Alright, so here\u2019s the deal: I live in a sharehouse and this chick moved in with us about 3 weeks ago. Since then, we\u2019ve practically spent every moment at home together and were moving from a friendship to something more. When I told her I liked her about 2 weeks ago, I already knew she liked another guy but I was fine with it, since she was also interested in me. A week ago the guy starts liking her back (even though they can\u2019t speak, as he doesn\u2019t speak English and she doesn\u2019t speak his language) and starts getting all touchy-feely with her. I didn\u2019t expect this to bother me, but it did and after a couple of days I asked her to cut the crap and make a choice. I mean, I don\u2019t think anyone would like to connect with someone and then watch another guy be on top of them.\nWhen I told her that we had a small argument and she said she liked him because of his vibe, and that it was \u201cspecial\u201d because she liked him \u201cwithout having to exchange words.\u201d\nAlright, you like him more, I get it. But now the dude is constantly trying to cuddle her and be on top of her, trying to kiss her, and while she says she wants to take things slow, she doesn\u2019t do anything and it\u2019s starting to get me pretty pissed. I can\u2019t walk into my own living room without seeing this happening and am wondering if I\u2019m the asshole for asking her to, and I quote, \u201cget a room.\u201d\nI already asked her and she said she\u2019d do it but nothing has changed and it\u2019s making me pretty miserable whenever I\u2019m at home since I have to deal with seeing her here.\n\nTL;DR: Am I the asshole for trying to make her get a room? Would I be the asshole if I confront her once more and nicely ask her to \u201cget a fucking room\u201d? The thing is that since we all live here asking for something like this is sorta crossing the line. \n\nEDIT: After reading some of the replies on here, I decided to talk to her. I apologized for asking her to stop doing things in the common areas, since it wasn't my right to ask her to stop (which she surprisingly said wasn't necessary. Apparently she'd been feeling really bad about doing it in front of me and would've been a lot angrier if our roles were reversed. She wanted to stop him but was really bad at saying no.) and we talked about a few other things. I told her it'd be best if we just gave each other some time without talking to really think about what we both think\/feel\/want and then talk about it.\n\nSecond EDIT: It's 5am so I'm going to bed and will try to reply to everyone in 5-6 hours when I wake up. Thanks a lot!","20":"tl\/dr is pretty much the title.\n\nAlso I know this isn't my JNMIL, but to my fiance, she's a JNMIL. \n\nAnd sorry if this turns into a rant, the surgery was a couple days ago and I'm still pissed at her.\n\nSo a little background. My mom is an insane, batshit crazy, raging bitch. And she hates my fiance.\n\nI have severe endometriosis and couldn't afford the surgery, and my parents offered to pay for it, which was amazing.  But a couple days before the surgery, I told her I would have my fiance take me, and she flipped the fuck out. She said since she's paying for it she needs to take me and take care of me, no one else is allowed to do that. If I refused and had my fiance take me, she would've called the office and ask them to refund her. She explicitly said so. I of course was shocked and agreed to having her take me. \n\nShe was delighted of course, and I was dreading it. \n\nThe day if the surgery comes and it's okay, but my mom was really upset that she couldn't find the charger to her camera. She wouldn't say what she needed the camera for, which was a bit odd. She also had a carry on suitcase with her I forgot to ask about. After the surgery she drops me off at home and leaves.\n\nI was relieved she left, but also confused because she wanted to take care of me?\n\nLater that night I was browsing Facebook and saw that right after dropping me off she went straight to the airport and took a vacation to California. She just up and left to go to San Francisco. What the fuck?\n\nSo thanks mom, thanks for forcing me to have you with me on the day I needed my fiance the most. And thank you for leaving without warning after you said you would take care of me. \n\nOkay, rant over.","21":"While being highly praised by many, the first games that came were generally a cluster of fucks, having awful battle sprites, an imbalanced battle system, awkward use of HM's Key items, and various gamebreaking and easily accessed glitches. The Pok\u00e9mon in this generation were okay, with only a few bland design choices (Mr. Mime, Muk, Jynx, Electrode etc.)\n\nGeneration 2 fixed these issues, had updated and cozy-colored graphics and added more content which fitted the Pok\u00e9mon vibe: A bug catching contest, simple breeding, a map twice the size the one in the games before, new evolution methods, Battle Tower etc. The only really bad part about these games were the Time Capsule (which was needed to obtain every Pok\u00e9mon) and the GS Stone; a Key item that only could be obtained through a specific internet event and was required to catch Celebi. The Pok\u00e9mon in these generation felt new and unique, but still felt very much in place with the earlier ones.\n\nGeneration 3 was okay. The graphics were allright in Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald, but looked weirldy compressed in FireRed and LeafGreen. The newly added Pok\u00e9mon were nice, but what bothers me about these games is the addition of Natures and the manipulation of EV's and IV's. While I think Abilities are a nice bonus to the Pok\u00e9mon, being able to change EV's and IV's ultimately ruins the feeling that Pok\u00e9mon is supposed to give you; that your Pok\u00e9mon is your partner. Because of this, it doesn't matter which Pok\u00e9mon you chose as your starter or which one is your favorite, since you will have to breed forth the strongest one for days if you want to use it competitively. This point is biggest reason I've started to lose hype about Pok\u00e9mon in general.\n\nGeneration 4, 5, and 6 were good, okay and less than impressive respectively. Gen 4 is my second favorite after 2 since I like the graphics, the music, the Pok\u00e9mon, the story and the postgame. Gen 5 had a generally bland design overall, as the words best used to describe the games is \"gray\" and \"dull\". Some of the Pok\u00e9mon were good, but many were forgettable. Lastly, Gen 6 had good graphics and good features such as liberated character mobility and character customization, but had too many bad Pok\u00e9mon designs, forgettable music, obvious plot twists and Mega Evolutions. Also, according to these three games, every legendary ever needs at least one alternate form.\n\nTL;DR: Being able to breed your Pok\u00e9mon to a pristine aryan man and pumping it with roids ruins the game for me","22":"Obligatory this did not happen today. I have Protanopia, the color Red is non-existent to me, as well as most of the green spectrum, with a considerable part of the blue spectrum classified as \"Muddied\"\n\nback in 2006 I took a job outside of my chosen field, working in the transportation department, doing cargo shipping and receiving, I had been working on the software side of the industry and after being laid off, I called in a favor and started in the physical side of things.\n\nStarted out in an air cargo company, small outfit, less then 10 people, domestic and international cargo transport, I know the vernacular, I know how this works and I've got the talent to make things happen.\n\nI realize that I excel at the whole negotiation process in terms of cost for cargo and things are going smoothly,\n\nOne day, I'm tasked to do some work in the records room, sorting and filing waybills, I'm given the instructions,\n\n\"International shipments go into these folders\" Points to stack of boxes with open box of folders on the top \"Domestic shipments go into these folders Points to different stack\n\nPut waybills into folders, label with first name of supplier and store in drawer\n\nI bang it out, I'm on fire, I blitz through the back log and I get through 6 months of backlog in a day and a half.\n\nThe fuck up?\n\nFolders were red, and tan,\n\nI saw no difference, no one said any difference and the boxes under the open ones were mixed up,\n\ncue 4 months later, we are doing an audit and one of the files is noted to be in the wrong folder, then another, then another.\n\nThe company is in panic mode, because now their system cannot be trusted, so if they get an investigative hold, they might miss the paperwork etc etc.\n\nA memo comes out, and the whole company comes in over the weekend to basically re-sort the last 2 years worth of cargo waybills, we all sit down, grab boxes and start sorting, and that's when I realize that this is all my fault.\n\nSo I'm sitting there, holding up 2 folders, trying to tell them apart when the owner asks me \"What the F$#% are you doing?\"\n\nand I tell him that I'm color blind, that these look exactly the same, and that I'm pretty sure I screwed everyone's weekend up.\n\nI wish I could say a good laugh was had, but no, it was not, they were angry that I didn't bring it up before, It's not something that really effects life so I tend to not think about it, but in this case, yeah, totally my bad.\n\nProbably cost the company a good chunk of cash, everyone most of the weekend.\n\nWhen I was laid off a few months later, I really wasn't surprised.\n\nTL;DR: Mixed up Domestic and international waybills because I never mentioned being colorblind causing overtime expenses to fix my mistake. \n\n**EDIT** - As been stated, I was not fired for the mix up, the economy was tanking and the company went from moving 20+ shipments a day to maybe 3, the writing was on the wall. ","23":"A month or so ago, my not-so-long-term girlfriend [19F] broke up with me [20M]. I shall call her Emma from here. We had been dating for about 2-3 months. We agreed to continue being friends since we shared friends before, and saw no reason to not continue doing the same after the breakup. I was a little down, but all in all in pretty good spirits. Emma had her close friend ask me if I was okay later in the week, which was nice, and I told her that I was fine and nobody need worry.\n\nWe all went to a party about a week or so after this, got fairly drunk, and I got together with a girl who we are both friends with [also 19F], who I shall call Olivia. I was very good friends with her before this. We continued to see each other in the next few weeks, leading to now. \n\nOlivia and I (perhaps a fuck up on my part) decided to keep it quiet amongst our friends, and tried not to tell anyone about our arrangement. We were not sure how long we would want to keep seeing each other and didn't want to 'rock the boat' in the friendship group, especially since Emma and I had just broken up.\n\nEmma finds out pretty quickly after her previously mentioned close friend somehow found out (not sure how) that we were making out at the party. She is quite distressed by this. I didn't find this out until she confronted me about all this recently.\n\nWe continue to see each other privately, and admittedly sneak off together after nights out (we are students). \n\nAll was well until I got horribly drunk last week. We all went to a bar, where I arrived late. I was sort of pleased to find out that Emma has found some guy to pair off with for the night, as this makes me feel a little more justified in seeing Olivia. A few of us went back to someone in the groups flat, it was a group of about 5 of my closer friends (including Olivia, not including Emma or her closer friends). I let it slip when I was blacked out that Olivia and I were seeing each other (as she told me the next day as she filled me in). I woke up very embarrassed and swearing off the drink as per usual. I had however allowed our arrangement to become *public knowledge*.\n\nEmma found out about this pretty quickly, and she later tells me she feels horrible. She says when she confronts me about it by text that I was wrong to hide it from her if I wanted to spare her feelings, made her \"feel like shit\", \"this has really changed my perception of you\". I keep my cool here and don't share with her my actual opinion on the topic of her involvement.\n\nNow I shall show my bias. In my opinion, she has nothing to do with this, it's not her problem, she isn't my problem. She broke up with me, I don't believe in a grace period between relationships, I don't think she had a 'right to know'. In my view, **I owe her nothing at all**. I hold these opinions regretfully, because before this I really rather liked her.\n\nSorry for rambling, so here's a **TL;DR: Emma breaks up with me, all good. I hook up with Olivia, kept it a secret, Emma not so happy when she finds out a few weeks down the line.**\n\nThank you, I will try to answer questions quickly.","24":"Alrighty guys, I've got an interesting one.\n\nSo to start off, I'm 17 years old and have only really dated a couple of people in my teen years. One of them was a girl, I'll call her Megan, who I 'dated' (if you can even really call it that) maybe 3 years ago. I don't remember the actual timeline, but that's a ballpark. Well, Megan and I only really dated for like four months on and off and nothing was ever serious at all, even for 14 year olds. We stopped talking for awhile after that because the whole thing was pretty stupid and rocky even for young teenagers, but eventually maybe a year later we reconnected somewhat and became sort of distant friends I guess? I don't really know how to describe it because we never really talked all that much except for seeing each other's posts on social media and checking in once and a while. We were amicable. I would see her post on her social media sometimes about missing an ex and how she had only dated two people, so based on process of elimination I knew there was about a 50\/50 chance it could be me, but since our 'relationship' was so flimsy and childish and not even really a real relationship at all, I thought it was someone else. Well, tonight kind of changed that.\n\nI hadn't really talked to Megan in about a month, and I think our last interaction was something about her telling me if I ever needed to talk or anything I could talk to her. She's a really nice girl and we are both going through a lot of problems with depression and anxiety and other things, so I pretty much have just thought we would continue speaking occasionally and being kind people. Distant friends. Tonight I was going through my normal night routine; watching Netflix and sitting in bed. I was actually FaceTiming one of my best friends Thomas (I'll use his real name, he's not really a part of the story) when I started getting Snapchat notifications that I was receiving videos from Megan. I got maybe 5 of the notifications, and I was confused but I thought it was either a long streaks video that sent in multiple segments or that Snapchat's notification system was broken. A few minutes later I got off the phone with my buddy and checked the videos, and they were videos of Megan, drunk and topless and telling me I 'am a great person' and I 'deserve better than her' and she started talking about how she regretted a lot of the things she had done to me when we were together. She was clearly drunk and topless, and she didn't flash me or anything, but I saw enough to know that there was definitely no clothes on the upper half of her body. I listened to the whole thing and at the end she said if she didn't remember this in the morning that I should remind her.\n\nI don't know why but the whole encounter has really weirded me out. I'm not attracted to this girl at all, and when I dated her I was just a desperate 14 year old who would date anyone who liked me. I also am currently in a relationship with someone and I do not in any way want to mess things up. I'm not too worried about that aspect though, I'm just generally kind of confused and weirded out by this. It was very odd and out of the blue and I have never really had anything like this happen to me yet. I do not like this girl back, and I honestly find it a bit strange that she is still hung up on me after three years going by since an awful childish middle school relationship. I haven't even seen the girl in person since we dated. The entire ordeal has just come off as very creepy.\n\nI am asking any of you older or more experience in situations like this for any advice on what I should do? I don't even know how to approach it. I'm extremely uncomfortable with the whole thing and just want to prevent it from happening again and let her know I'm not interested in that way, but I also don't want to be mean or upset her because she's genuinely a nice person. Thanks guys\n\nTL;DR: A girl I dated years ago at a very young age sent me a drunken video saying some creepy shit. How do I approach this?","25":"Backstory:  \n\nMy FH and I have been together for 7 years \\(it will be 8 two days after the wedding\\) and during the early stages of our being together \\(as teenagers in highschool\\) my dad cheated on my mom with FH's mom...  This completely ruined any hope of us being one big happy family.. my FMIL blew the thing off like it didnt happen and has kinda labeled my mom as crazy when it comes to the situation.. I dont want to get on fmil's bad side.. but thats MY mom she's calling crazy and to be frank, my mom didnt do a damn thing wrong.  \n\nMy dad has since admitted everything to my mom and has apologized \\(time and time again\\) and they have made mends.. well now FMIL is re\\-married and has asked me if my dad \\(who is an incredible artist\\) can draw a big picture of her NUDE so she can give it to her husband as a gift..  \n\nI of course said no.. for obvious reasons but I swear I am terrified that she is going to ask my dad at the wedding \\(she now lives in a different state with her new husband, so she never sees my mom or dad anymore\\) or act a certain way around him \\(ask him to dance.. hug on him.. kiss him on the cheek, etc\\) because my mom has let me know that she will be civil UNLESS fmil approaches my dad in any kind of inappropriate way..  \n\nHAAAAAAAAALPPPPPP  My mom honestly doesnt even want FMIL there.. but of course that isnt an option.. Does anyone have any advice for my \"days of our lives\" situation? lol \n\n TL;DR my dad cheated on my mom with FMIL years ago.. now Im terrified im going to have a momma brawl at my wedding.","26":"Hey guys...I heard about reddit and this subreddit from my friend. She said the people here were nice...\n\nAnyway...3 months ago I lost my husband. He died in a car accident when he was driving home from work. It was a rainy day, and the funeral was a week later. Around a week later, I came home from work to find my mother-in-law's car waiting outside my apartment. I had already talked to her at the funeral, and honestly our relationship was rocky already...I think she blamed me for being infertile. I walked up to the car, and at the same time, she got out. When I went to greet her, she slapped me. I was so confused...she scolded about me not calling her after the funeral, and asked me why I was not grieving and at work. I didn't tell her, but it was because the funeral was expensive and way out of our budget.\n\nAfter I got back up, she began to threaten to hit me again, and said what happened to what her son left her in his will. Which made me angry because he had not written his will. We didn't think we would need wills this early.\n\nWhen I told her that I wasn't going to give her anything, she slapped me again and started screaming how I was a whore and how I had meant to not have his kids...\n\nOver the next week she harassed me on the phone until I stopped picking up my phone. Around a week after I stopped picking up the phone, I came home to my mother-in-law in front of her car, and a moving truck parked outside my apartment. She again demanded that she was promised her share, and that she had come to claim it. I again told her no multiple times over the next hour, until at last the moving truck guys drove off. She said that I would regret this and left. I didn't think anything of it except her harassing me again on my phone, so I blocked her number.\n\nShe came to my workplace a week later. She verbally abused me in front of all my coworkers...talking about how I married her son for his money, about how I had killed him for his life insurance pay out. He didn't have life insurance...she came again the next day, and my coworkers didn't let her through the door. This has been going on for around a week, and it is making my life miserable...\n\nI don't want to get the police involved...\nWhat should I do?\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Mother-in-law is making my life miserable by stalking me and harassing me...\n\n**EDIT**: I think I will call the police but I still don't think I can afford a lawyer...\n\n**EDIT 2**: I am going to the police station today. Thank you everyone for your advice! I have no idea what to do, whether to see if I can get a lawyer or just stick with a restraining order. I don't know what will happen at the police station either.\n\n**EDIT 3**: It's over. I talked to the police, and it took a couple hours to get statements from my coworkers, my boss, and they said it takes around a week to get a restraining order, but if she tries it again, they will arrest her...they haven't taken any immediate action, as they felt it would be a little too rushed, with few sources, all of which are bias to me (I agree) but they said if she does it again, \"she's gone.\" I guess going to the police was the best option. Thank you everyone!","27":"So to start out my husband's family has a weird dynamic. His mother never grew up enough to care for him properly so his grandparents (her mom and dad) stepped up. This makes it feel like I have two fucking terrible mother in laws! I am just thankful for my husband's grandfather because without that man to guide him through life he would be just as awful as these women. Anyway ...\n\nLast week we went to my husband's grandparents to help fix some issue they were having with their t.v. It was about 2 in the afternoon and we had taken my son to the park and walked around a bit that day before going over there. I should also mention I'm about a week away from 9 months with our second and my feet felt like they would Burst. When we arrive they were outside planting new bushes in their flower beds. My husband's grandfather takes us inside (while granny stays out planting) and we get everything squared away for them and leave shortly after. No big deal, just the usual \"hey guys, you're welcome, see you later\" dialogue. A few hours later my husband's mother texted him that \"her mother said I didn't like her\" and I guess I was rude. \ufffd\ufffd This is the only time in about 9 years that I have not sat and had a long (mostly one sided) conversation with this women, but whatever I chalked it up to she is old and that's just the way things use to be. \n\nFast forward to yesterday. My husband's uncle invites us over to his house for a Father's day cookout. We show up and my husband's grandfather asked him to drive him back to the store because he forgot something he was asked to bring. I stayed behind with our son and made sure to say hello and talk a bit with my grandmother in law so not to offended her again. All goes smooth. I even stared to have a really long in depth conversation with the uncle's wife who I have really only even talked to in passing at family events. It was nice and everyone was happy and having a good time. That was untill 2 hours after the party stared and my MIL showed up. She was upset because the food was cold\/almost gone, her uninvited guest was not really welcome, and to top it off my husband and I were getting ready to leave to go home and relax before work the next day. The last 30 minutes we were there she sat off in the corner texting on her phone not talking to anyone and at this point I was finishing up my earlier conversation with the uncle's wife. Well today my husband gets home from work and tells me he got another message about me from his mother...\ufffd\ufffd. This time she is offended that I was talking to the uncle's wife and not to her! \n\nIdk maybe this sounds super dumb to be mad about. It could also just be the cherry on top of the shit Sunday these women put me through, but I feel like I can't win no matter what I do. It's like sometimes they are trying to train me like a dog. Talk now, sit here, speak! Them texting my husband about my \"bad behavior\" is really just a rolled up newspaper to my back end. It does feel a little better getting this out there and good Lord knows I didn't intend on writing a freaking book, but here it is \ufffd\ufffd\n\nTLDR: my grandmother in law and my mother in law get offended by me not talking to them when they feel I should. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd","28":"TL;DR College counselors are your best friend, don't blow them off!\n\nThis was several years ago.  Relevantly, in the era before computers were very prominent, and few students had a PC. \n\nSo, I played music in college.  In fact, I started off going for my music degree, fine arts major (music performance) with a math minor.  But junior year, I broke my hand, and realized how fragile a musician's life could be, so I switched.  Didn't want a full math major.  So, that late, the only degree I could get in a reasonable time was a General Liberal Arts Bachelor.  Requirements:  a certain number of credits, a certain proportion of which had to be upper division, with a selection of classes in different fields.  I already had all the credits I needed in math and fine arts, so I figured I needed about two years, taking all the 300 and 400 level classes I could with no or minimal prerequisites.   I figured it out for myself, never consulted with an advisor or councilor.  Didn't have the ability to check graduation progress online, but who needs that, I can see the requirements myself in the student handbook.  This is my biggest fuck-up in the story, probably the biggest of my life.\n\nI had taken freshman history, so I was able to get into 300 and 400 history.  AP in high school got me the basics in English, so I took 300 and 400 level lit classes.  For science I took a semester of physics, and then was able to get into 300 and 400 level anthropology.  A couple of others - linguistics, sociology, econ. \n\n2.5 years later, I'm done.  I haven't quit playing music, I still enjoyed it for sports, and all my friends were in these groups,  plus there were paying gigs.  Like graduation.  I played in the graduation band ($50 or so, as I recall), wearing cap and gown, like seniors do.  It's a big school, they didn't call individual names at the mass graduation, just, \"grads from the school of engineering (or whatever) stand up!\"  And I, in general liberal arts, didn't really want to go to my college's private graduation later.\n\nSo, I figured I'd get my diploma later.  I never did, but I was working full time, getting married that summer, and I never noticed. \n\nI have a job that never required proof of graduation.  But then, they instituted a certification that did.  So, no problem, I called the U. and told them to send my transcript.  They said \"No problem, but do you realize you never graduated?\"\n\nI was beyond flummoxed.  What the hell, I knew I had all the credits I needed, what's wrong?\n\nMusic performance credits.  You take a band, orchestra, jazz band, chamber music class, usually 2 or 3 of those, every semester as a performance major.  Those are hard credits, usually only like one credit hour for three hours worth of work, not to mention practice.  They're demanding.  But for the General degree, they wouldn't count repetitions of the same classes toward the number of credits earned.  I was 9 credits short. \n\nI had written on my resume that I graduated.  For several years.  This was about 12 years after the fact before I found this out.  The U. never contacted me.  I couldn't believe it.  I needed this for my job now.  But I had no college degree.\n\nSo, I went back to school, knocked out 9 hours of night classes and distance learning in a semester.  Turns out, the University has a department made for helping \"dropouts\" get their degrees, so I even got a scholarship.  I took a GIS class, architecture, and City Planning.  Because why not?  They were fun, I learned a lot, and knocked them out in a few months.  But no one in my life will ever let me forget that I lied for several years and pretended I was a college graduate.","29":"My apartment consists of 4 tenants and 1 sublease. One of the tenants is my boyfriend and he lives in my room with me. The sublease is my friend and the other two girls are tenants with their own rooms. The two girls have made copies of their house keys and given them to people I do not know. These people have let themselves in without anyone's permission besides the people who gave them the key. My boyfriend has seen both of my roommates boyfriends come in on their own to do various \"chores\" while my roommates are away. They do not tell anyone they are coming in and do not lock the door when they leave. My roommates have not asked us to do these chores for them, instead they went straight to making copies of their keys and giving them to people *they* trust. \n\nToday I was playing Overwatch in the den and the doorbell rang. I heard the girl in the apartment upstairs talking to someone on the phone. She told whoever she was talking to that she knew my bf and I were at the house. I did not let her in because I was curious as to what she was doing. She then let herself in the previously locked door to my apartment. I asked her why she was here and she said she was getting something from my roommate's room. My roommate has a lock she installed on her door and apparently this girl has the spare to not only our apartment, but also my RM's door. I, obviously, do not. \n\nWhen she was done in there she came in the den and asked where the (MY) hdmi cable was. I told her I was using it. She told the person on the phone (my roommate, obviously). Before she left I asked her to give me back her spare key to the apartment. She did. \n\nI contacted my roommate and learned that this girl, their bfs, and her other friend all have copies of my apartment key. This is not ok. I told her it makes me uncomfortable to have people I don't know coming in and that it needs to stop. She hung up on me. \n\nWhat do I do to get the keys away from these people? They are apparently coming in and taking our things without me knowing and I am extremely uncomfortable knowing I have no say in who comes into my personal space. On top of that we live in a bad area and they are leaving doors unlocked. My bf and sublease are also uncomfortable with this but do not know what to say. My bf almost drew his gun on my RM's bf at 2am when he let himself in. This is clearly not ok but I don't know what to do to resolve this? \n\nTL;DR: 2\/5 roommates making copies of their keys and giving them to strangers without permission. They are not willing to take them away. I feel unsafe in my own home but am unable to move out until June. ","30":"This woman isn\u2019t even my MIL yet and she\u2019s already causing problems.\n\nMy boyfriend and I haven\u2019t been together too terribly long, but we already feel a very strong connection. I\u2019ve been deliriously happy with him up to this point. A family friend of his is getting married next weekend, and he told his mother back in June that he would be bringing someone. I asked for the weekend off of work and that was that. But apparently his mother RSVP\u2019d for him without telling him until today, and she only put him down for one. It\u2019s too late to change it now. I\u2019ve already heard enough warnings about his mother, including that she was part of the reason him and his last girlfriend broke up, but he desperately tried to reassure me that it wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Now, she\u2019s refusing to budge, and he\u2019s forced to go to this wedding. Since my schedule for work is already out, I\u2019m going to be alone the whole weekend with no one else to keep me company. My mental health is in rough shape right now, so I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be safe if I\u2019m alone. Boyfriend has told me that not going to the wedding will cause a major argument. He\u2019s not 100% financially independent yet, and he feels as though his mom would cut him off over this. His mom seems to really have her claws deep in him: she won\u2019t even let him change his permanent address to where he lives on his own, one state away from her.\n\nTl;dr Is it reasonable for me to be this upset over a stupid wedding? All of these red flags are up and I\u2019m absolutely scared. What should I do?","31":"Context: So today I was helping at a Japanese-themed workshop, and I was leading the origami \"department.\" I had made some origami to showcase (from expensive imported Japanese origami paper) that took a lot of effort - I had to spend a rather large amount of time on it as I wanted it to be as close to perfect as possible. \n\nPlease note that the workshop was FREE, and we did provide paper - just not the most expensive stuff, and people could take what they made home. Again, for no cost at all.\n\n\u200b\n\nNow that you know what I was dealing with, here comes the actual conversation with the EP. \n\nEP: \\*comes to the origami table with her 8 to 10-year-old son, handles example of a rather complicated origami piece\\* Hello, is it possible to make this and take it home? I really like it.  \nMe: Sure! Are you or your son going to be making the piece? It's a rather time-consuming one, and it requires tremendous amounts of concentration and precision as every single mistake will offset it noticeably.  \nEP: My son, but don't worry! I'm absolutely sure he can do it.  \nMe: Alright. \\*shows her son how to do it\\* \n\nOver the course of making the origami, her son ruined multiple sheets of perfectly good paper, and the ones that he didn't ended up being horribly imprecise (it's a modular origami that requires 8 sheets). I tried to fix what he did, but to no avail. \n\nMe, to EP: I'm sorry, it's not possible to make this into the final product - it is so imprecise it's not even possible to assemble. (\"What did I tell you, woman?!\" I think to myself)\n\nEP: You should've told me my son wouldn't be able to make it!\n\nMe: I did, and you explicitly denied it! \n\nA heated argument breaks out - you can imagine how it goes.\n\nConversation continues after it:  \nEP: You know what? You should give us this one (pointing at the one made out of expensive paper I spent hours on)  \nMe: Sorry, that one is only for display purposes.\n\nEP: I don't care. You are wasting our time. I came here for my son to make some nice origami but you failed to deliver, so I want compensation.\n\nMe: Sorry to say this, but I believe that, as compensation, would be completely inadequate to the situation, even if your point was valid. \n\nAnother argument breaks out. \n\nShe didn't get the origami. \n\nTLDR: Woman with son comes to FREE workshop to make origami, he fails horribly, she wants the one we had on display, into which a lot of time and money (expensive origami paper) was invested because we were \"wasting her time\".","32":"Long-time lurker here. Before you ask, yes, I took several pregnancy tests and my birth control does not inhibit me from having a normal my menstrual cycle. I haven't embarked on any crazy diets or exercise schedules...\n\nI have a full-time job (40-60 hours\/week) as a staff member at a university in a very small college. Think one person, at best two, per professional field, no sense of teamwork whatsoever. I started about 7 months ago and I was under incredible stress (moving to a new house alone, starting a new job, etc.). At the beginning I loved it and it was a million times better than my previous position which was in a totally different field that became monotonous and the work environment was toxic. I felt a decent amount of respect at my new job, but I realized that my two bosses were forcing me to do projects outside of my contract agreement because I worked so diligently and always met deadlines whatever the cost. Yes, I had no one else to go to for help with these projects and I had no ability to hire another person.\n\nAbout 5 months ago, I stopped getting my period which was out-of-nowhere. I figured \"Hey, my coworker just quit, I'm taking over her responsibilities (basically another full-time position) and taking a higher level class. Management will just hire a decent replacement to take her place so I won't be as stressed.\" Dear readers, that clearly wasn't the case. Between the class, working both mine and my ex-coworker's jobs, undoing and redoing the mess my new coworker made, and doing half of another coworker's responsibilities.... it was a lot and I stupidly thought nothing of it because I wanted to keep the job. The pay isn't great, I just wanted to pay rent and have my semi-comfortable lifestyle. I had a coworker miscarry three times at another job and I thought \"pfft... that won't happen to me here\". To be safe, I took a pregnancy test, it came back negative, and I went on my merry way.  \nA second month passed and I still wasn't pregnant, but my stress kept inundating me. Another one passed, same story, but more responsibilities. At that time, I got scared because I've never gone more than two months without getting my period (except for the time when I was anorexic at 16 \\[which required hospitalization\\] and didn't get it for nearly 3 years, but that's another story entirely). Plus, given that history, I have to be extra cautious with that facet of my life. I told my two supervisors that this job and my multitude of responsibilities was unsustainable and I was being severely overworked, my coworkers saw the stress wear on me, and I wasn't being myself around my boyfriend (who I love more than anything in this world) or anyone who I truly cared about. Both supervisors told me that they'd work on it to decrease my stress and to have people help me out which made me feel a it reassured.  \nA few weeks after, nothing changed and it got worse. I had to pick up more slack and babysit more of my awful coworker and it then wore more at my mental health. After another big handful of weeks, it started to wear at my relationship with my boyfriend to the point where he had to tell me that I was losing who I am and that I was hurting him given the way I'd subconsciously lash out at him due to stress. I honestly couldn't tell that my words held that much weight and I vowed to resolve it because I truly love him.   \nSo that brings us to today... 5 months, no signs or symptoms of menstruation. It's been too long and my bosses' promises were not fulfilled, better yet processed in one ear and out the other. I told both of my bosses that I'm quitting. My female boss knows it's my elongated period of missed periods. My male boss knows that parts of my body are shutting down due to the stress. I plan on taking as much time off as possible after this week until the last day at my job in early June and I'm excited to correct the wrongness I did to my body and focus on getting a more stable, sane job. A few people have noted that I look less stressed already after giving my two week's notice without knowing what has gone on the past few months. I want to take the month of June to relax and reset my body because one shimmering bits of hope that drove me to get out of the psychiatric hospital where I rotted for 4 months was having healthy children. I want a family with the love of my life more than anything and I can't let any job ruin that for me nor should any job ruin that for anyone.  \n\nTLDR: I didn't get my period for 5 months after stress and responsibilities at work didn't ease up despite my bosses' reassurances and promises. I finally quit today and it feels great.","33":"My brother and his wife wanted to go out with some friends. I can't remember the exact details but my mom who was supposed to watch their kids but asked me to take the youngest, my nephew, to divide and conquer. He was the easiest baby so it wasn't an issue. Small side note, my nephew looks like a clone of me. We compared baby pictures and my SIL had trouble telling them apart alike. \n\nThat same day I had my nephew my SO and I had plans to go to a party at one of his Aunts. Aside from Wendy, FIL and Aunt no one else knew we were watching my nephew. There is family there that hasn't seen my SO in a long time which is one of the reasons SO wanted me to come. Wendy comes over super friendly, which was odd for her, grabs my nephew and starts showing him off. I didn't think anything of it at the time and assumed she loved babies. I'm a baby hog myself. I over hear laughs and things like \"look who Libida brought\", \"my baby\", \"SO is so good with him\" and other things about our \"little family.\" But she always giggles a bit after saying anything so I assume it's all a joke over a misunderstanding and she's explaining that we are baby sitting. If I'm going to be completely honest, I wasn't super focused on the comments or Wendy. They were serving damn good food and I love me a delicious potato salad and bratwurst.\n\nSeveral people come up and say how cute Nephew is. They said how we look so much alike. I say we do look a lot a like but my whole dads side look very similar so it's not surprising my nephew looked like me. There are a few puzzled looks and some say things to the effect of \"oh he's your nephew\" and \"I must have missed some thing.\" I don't think much of it because I assume they missed something too. Others ask how he got his name because it's not common. I say he is named after my brother who is named after my dad and so on. Again, puzzled looks and realizations are happening. Many people seemed to know he was my nephew though so again, I'm thinking some people are mistaken, mishearing or making assumptions. I mean, my SO and I haven't even been together long enough for me to have a baby, let alone one a few months old. Even if I conceived on our first date I'd still be pregnant.\n\nWhen we go to leave Wendy is holding nephew again (he'd been passed around a bit, all with my permission) and I when I ask for him back she clings jokingly \"don't take my baby!\" giggles and hands him over after giving him a big kiss. Again, it was totally out of character but at the time I really thought she just loved babies and Nephew was bringing out another side of her. I didn't realize it was the crazy side. I mean really, what person would try to pull off a stunt that makes her look like a grandma with someone else's kid? It sounds very circumstantial and if this were my only misunderstanding incident with her I would have brushed it off. But after years with this women I have realized \"misunderstandings\" is one of her methods to manipulate and get what she wants. I soon realized she was grandson crazy (granddaughters are nice but boys are where it's at) when I became pregnant soon after. \n\nTL;DR Wendy \"plays\" grandma with my nephew so convincingly distant family think me and my SO had a kid when we were actually baby sitting.","34":"Literally happened today. If I had hard alcohol on hand I would be drinking it right now and drunk-texting the shit out of my friends. I settle instead for a whopping 4.6% Tuborg Classic and Reddit.\n\nI'm an American living in Denmark. Moved here 2 years ago for an engineering job, ended up loving my job and haven't left. Bought an apartment. Learned Danish. The whole shebang. There's one fly in the ointment: no mountains here. And I can't afford a car to drive to Sweden on the weekends. I'm a sponsored mountain unicyclist (yes, that's a thing), so I just wanna go on adventures and train in the mountains but I can't do that with public transit. Long story short: I really want a car. But I can't afford one right now.\n\nBut hope...hope came to me today. I posted a picture on Instagram from the Red Bull Cliff-Diving finals on Saturday (they were cool), and I received a message request. From Red Bull Denmark.\n\n\"Congratulations!\" it said in Danish. \"It's a really beautiful picture. We've selected you as the winner of our contest!\" I was mildly stoked -- maybe I won sunglasses or something. But after messaging back and forth with the lady, I realized I didn't just win *some swag*.\n\nI had won an [Opel Grandland X](https:\/\/www.opel.dk\/biler\/grandland-x\/model-oversigt.html), a car that is fucking *designed* for adventures and awesome shit. Oh, and did I mention this car is valued at 280.000 dkk, which is about $43,000? I freaked out, had to leave my work meeting to calm myself down. In the last message from Red Bull Denmark, the lady asked (in Danish) \"Now I just need to check, you have a Danish driver's license, right?\"\n\nHere's the fuck-up.\n\nLast winter, I asked the Danish government to switch my driver's license from an American one to a Danish one. (Americans can do this.) What's supposed to happen is that they take 6 months to send my license to the Colorado DMV to check that it's valid (because apparently they can't just phone the DMV or access a database idk) and then I should have my new Danish license. Instead, what happened was that I received a few letters in Danish (which I didn't really understand) and my license back. I didn't think much of it. Fuck me.\n\nI have just re-read the letters. Turns out the Danish police thought my license was fake, so in the first letter they told *me* to authenticate it...somehow. Then, since I never did anything after the first letter (since, you know, I didn't understand Danish at the time) they cancelled my application. Moreover, the letter says I can now only get a Danish driver's through a driving course. WHICH COSTS ALMOST TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. Bitch, if I had $2,000 I would probably be at the Swedish MTB park multiple weekends a year instead of just two.\n\nAnyway, you might guess the rest of this story. As soon as I told the lady from Red Bull Denmark that I didn't have a Danish driver's license, she ghosted me. That beautiful, sexy adventure beast from Opel has probably already been offered to some other lucky Instagrammer. \n\nTime to drink. Cheers, Reddit.\n\nTl;dr I didn't understand Danish when applying for a driver's license last year and didn't follow up on paperwork. I now have to pay almost $2,000 if I want a driver's license here, and I lost the chance to win a $43,000 sexy adventure car from Red Bull Denmark.\n\n**EDIT 1**: *SHIT I'M A BIG FAT PHONY*. Everyone kept asking me if the contest was a scam, so I went back to re-read the messages (yes they came from a verified Instagram account) and it turns out...you win the car for *30 days*. I'm a fucking idiot. Take my karma away, reddit, obviously I don't deserve it.\n\nOther random info:\n* Getting a lot of skepticism about my finances. Fair enough. I like transparency and open communication. Here's a copy of a comment I made below:  I am working for a university as an engineer doing a research. I've also agreed to a special contract where I have some extra unpaid time off so I can go to unicycle events more. My post-tax take home is about $2,821 per month. I am paying friends back an extra $1,233 every month for helping me crowd-source the deposit on my apartment. Then, you know, food and bills and stuff.    \n* For the mountain unicycling: I would route you to my website for more pictures and videos, since this is my public reddit account. But I can't give personal info on this subreddit, so I sadly can't do that. Instead, here is the [Kris Holm factory team webpage](http:\/\/krisholm.com\/en\/team\/), where you can find a bunch of people to follow on Instagram and stuff. :)\n\n**EDIT 2**: Just FYI, I'm actually female. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_\/\u00af","35":"So, I'm in a bit of a quandary in my new(ish) relationship: \n\nI've been dating \"Casey\" for 5 months and we have a really, really great thing going. It's this really easy sort of relationship that isn't melodramatic. Instead, we communicate easily, truly enjoy each other's companionship and have a great intellectual connection &amp; sexual chemistry. \n\nCasey has an older sister who got divorced a few years back (how many years back.. I'm not totally sure, but definitely more than 5). From that relationship, there were two kids and one of them \"Samantha\" is 13. Sam spends a lot of time with her grandmother, her biological father and Casey. Samantha's mom (Casey's sister) is a really nice person, but very scattered and definitely struggles taking care of two children. She has them for alternating months, so 1-on and 1-off. Her bio-dad seems really \"with it\" and seems to co-parent well. Here's the problem: \n\nWhen Samantha is with her mom, she's despondent, sort of almost resigned to her fate. And... she says things, but not things like a melodramatic teen girl, but scary things. This past weekend I told her that Casey and I were going to be gone this weekend (her first weekend with her mother for the month-long stretch) and she said: \"Oh... **great**\" and followed-up with \"who'll feed me? Wouldn't it be cool if you could just go to sleep and wake up a month later? Or not at all? That'd be really cool.\" Thing is, she says things like this ALL THE TIME. Comments about how she wishes she could just cease to exist, how she wishes she could just disappear or blink and be somewhere else. She's very curious about death and once asked me about firearm-related deaths (I deal with criminal law cases). People will joke about her and her 'boyfriend' and how they'll have kids one day and she made a comment quietly, but loud enough that I could hear, that she'd never \"bring a life into such misery.\" \n\nI know that Sam's mom tries, but really struggles with being a parent. It's anathema to her personality and I think she had kids to try and salvage her marriage to her ex-husband. \n\nMaybe I'm crazy, but this sounds less like a cry for help and more of a full-on scream. \n\nI have an inability to be tender when being direct, I guess it's just my personality. I have a hard time sort of talking to an issue, I am very direct and get to the point. If I was to say anything, I'd need to say it to my GF and although we communicate really well, this is sort of above my pay grade. \n\nI'm appealing to the group here: How do I talk about this without ruining my relationship with Casey or damaging her her relationship with her family? How can I tactfully bring this up? What sort of strategies should I use? \n\n---\ntl;dr Girlfriend's niece is screaming for help, but I don't feel like I have the skills I would need to talk to her aunt (my GF) about this in a constructive manner. What should I do?","36":"Some family background: my mother grew up in a shitty town, and her family is (relatively) wealthy. My aunt never left, and deeply resents my mother for leaving with my dad, viewing it as 'abandoning' the family. She has a lot of kids, but the one in question, Scumbag, is her favorite. Scumbag is nineteen, doesn't have a job or go to school, and smokes weed in his mother's basement all day.\n\nMy partner is trans (FtM) and has been the victim of violence because of it before. We also now have a shiny and perfect baby girl. Needless to say, hormones have me in a state of hypervigilance, which may have aggravated the situation.\n\nMy aunt invited herself to visit my mother, bringing Scumbag with her. No one wanted to cater her needs, which is a whole other thing, so she got shunted into a shitty hotel. Shortly into their visit, when my family was asleep, I was woken up by someone breaking my door open. I immediately woke up my partner to call the police, and grabbed my baseball bat.\n\nScumbag was wearing a mask and had a knife, so I hit him with the bat to eliminate the threat to my family. I got in about two swings in before Scumbag started screaming about a \"joke\" and it was \"just him.\" The police arrived and arrested his dumb ass. I severely bruised his ribs.\n\nI'm going full steam ahead on the criminal charges. I do not buy Scumbag's joke defense in the slightest. My partner, who is already stressed because of the baby, is barely sleeping now, and the break-in has caused terrible memories to resurface. I replaced all the screen doors with metal storm doors, installed brand new locks and deadbolts, and put in a new security system, yet we suddenly don't feel safe in our home. He's looking at several very severe charges, and the cops apparently found cocaine in his car.\n\nMy aunt is losing her mind and is using every possible avenue to inform me I'm a terrible person for making sure her criminal son goes to jail. I've stopped answering the phone when my great-grandmother calls, because it's inevitably my aunt waiting to scream at me. She's hurled abuse at my mother because \"blood is thicker than water,\" as if my dumb cousin is more important than my child and soulmate. My good old boy uncles have opted to 'not take sides,' but are subtly indicating they'd like for me to make the whole thing go away.\n\nI'm honestly ready to go completely no contact with that half of the family, but my aunt is paying for my cousin's lawyer and is trying to butt into the proceedings. I'd also like both my mother and siblings to go no contact as well, and I'm trying to think of a way to word this that doesn't seem to pressuring. My siblings, I think, will be pretty gung-ho, but my mother still has a good relationship with my great-grandmother (though this incident is souring it.)\n\ntl;dr: Dumbass cousin broke into my house with a knife. My aunt is losing her mind because I'm pressing forward with all charges. Want to go no contact, but want my whole family aboard as well.\n\nEdit: Clarity!","37":"So this has all happened in a three-month span. A couple weeks after I moved into a new apartment, at around 2am I wake up to vigorous banging on my door, doorbell ringing and my letterbox clanking, a male voice yelling he wants to talk to me. Living alone and having had some psycho exes in the past, it literally scared the shit out of me. Not getting an answer, he swears and slips a note in. It\u2019s surprisingly polite, something along the lines \u201cPlease stop having such loud sex in the night; I gotta go work in the morning.\u201d  \n \n\nAt that instant it had been a week since the last time I had sex in my apartment, and I didn\u2019t remember being that loud then either.  Anyway, as the note seems quite well-mannered but the timing is really odd, I read he\u2019s mixing me with somebody else. So I head out to the apartment below, where I can hear him continue yelling at this point. Whatever, I need to fix this.  \n \n\nA very angry looking guy with VERY dilated pupils (meth I guess?) flings the door open and starts yelling as soon as I explain him the situation. Apparently the walls are thin and I haven\u2019t noticed that so my average-volumed sex life has been annoying him for a while now. Remaining calm, I apologize any inconvenience etc etc. He does not stop. \n\nHe starts to IMITATE ME HAVING SEX at 2am at our fucking stairway. I tell him I can see he\u2019s angry and I get that, and that now that I learned about the poor soundproofing I will be more silent.  \n \n\nNO. He is not going to stop. He proceeds to audibly MOAN and QUOTE THE THINGS HE\u2019S HEARD ME SAY, insulting me and my boyfriend for being \u201cfucking rabbits\u201d and so on. Needless to say, I\u2019m both furious and scared shitless although my past experience with violent and intoxicated people makes me swallow it. Using all the possible non-violent communication techniques I know, I finally manage to calm him down and even to the point we can shake hands in agreement.  \n \n\nI enjoy a couple moths of peace, no new encounters. On Monday it started again, this time it was about the sounds of me putting together a bookcase with a hammer. In the middle of the day. And it\u2019s the first time ever I have used hammer in the apartment, or any other kind of loud instrument for that matter. I admit it could\u2019ve been loud, but you know, I just needed to do it.  \n A day goes by. In the next evening, I can hear him hammering his ceiling. No problem, maybe he\u2019s just having a good old hammer time, inspired by my project. The sound becomes louder and I can feel it in my floor already. Okay wow, he really doesn\u2019t hold back. A pause, and then the pounding continues louder than ever, traveling around the floor.  It becomes clear that he\u2019s communicating with me.\n\n \\--\n\nIt makes me wonder if he\u2019s going to throw a tantrum again the next time I see him. While I\u2019m not afraid of yelling, I find it uncomfortable to pass his front door during nights since I have no idea how physical he could get. Making a complaint for my landlord (owns the whole house) feels uncomfortable also \u2013 you know, even if he got kicked out he might as well get back at me later.   \n \n\nAny advice? I\u2019d really love to keep my apartment since it\u2019s hard to find one where I live and everything else here is perfect. I need to figure some kind of master plan, I guess.\n\nSorry for the English btw. Not my native tongue.  \nCouldn't really decide whether the topic is considered relevant in this sub but I'll give it a try.  \n \n\nTL;DR: my addict neighbor humiliates me by imitating my intimate life in the stairway at 2am and behaves all around aggressively. I fear him and his revenge if I report him, but don\u2019t want to lose my dream apartment either.","38":"Before we start I will say he was a German veteran of WWII, he was my grandfather but he in no way was a Nazi sympathizer. He was in the military before Hitler was in power and had no choice but to fight in the war.\n\nSo the story: When this happened I was really young like 6(?) So it's mostly from my mom and dad. So its basically like any other cast so the real only character I need to explain is J: J\u00fcrgen and GF: Grandfather P: Polizei\n\nSo we went to this festival in Germany for all the vets that served for the country. All the vets had a little reserved place for them and their family could go to while we stay in the field. It was going to be a nice play that was being played by some theatre kids(Like 18-21). So since my grandfather was a WWII vet he got a seat right up front. We had a number that matched a table. we were number 13 so we went to that table but hen we got there-there were already people there. It was a mother and her two kids. This is how it transpired\n\nMom: Excuse me, can you move. Our table is here\n\nShe looked at us like we're breaking into their house and stealing everything.\n\nEM: What do you mean? We were here first!\n\nMom: I know but my dad here\\*gesture towards my grandfather\\* is a WWII vet and they gave him th-\n\nEM: So he's a Nazi?\n\nthat really hit hard for my family as it is like the worst thing you could say to my grandfather as he already feels like shit for being in the war.\n\nEM: I'm not giving my seat for some Nazi! Leave!\n\nMy mom was super pissed! She started going off on this b\\*ch while my Grandfather and dad tried to calm her down while she was cussing and screaming at this lady. This called attention to my friend Dad's friend J\u00fcrgen who set up the whole thing.\n\nJ: Hey can you please quiet down so-\n\nEM: these people are trying to take our spot even though it's ours!\n\nJ: Uh mam, the seats are reserved for WWII vets.\n\nEM: So you're saying that since he's a nazi he gets the best spot! Apparently, nothing has changed from this country you racist sh\\*ts! I'm not moving for some Nazi piece of sh\\*t!\n\nEveryone around us finally looked at her and by now someone has called the Polizei and they came to see what was wrong\n\nP: What seems to be the problem ma'am\n\nEM: Theis sh\\*t heads are assaulting me!\n\nP2: Is this true \\*asking the tables around them\\*\n\nThey all said no and they arrested the mom for disrupting the peace. As they were taking here away she kept on saying vulgar stuff to my grandfather and my family as she was being taken away. They asked if we wanted to press charges but my grandfather said no(He was the kind of person that forgave everyone)\n\nWe later find out that she was American and her family was visiting a relative that moved from here. I know that Americans aren't all like that and I'm just sorry for her kids\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Lady thinks she can get the front sat since my grandfather is a WWII vet.\n\nEdit: Fixed some stuff and thanks to all the people that are saying its not my fault. I really appreciate it. :)\n\nEdit 2: let me just say thank you for your words as they give me encouragement and it helps me remember to not feel terrible to be german. Sadly my grandfather died(of old age and it was a while ago) but i think he would have loved to see your comments\n\nEdit3: dont be obligated to apologize for america. i know a lot of great people from America and have been their myself, they are great people and i have no hate towards them. only that lady","39":"[Link to the original thread.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/4kird3\/i_27_f_want_to_propose_to_my_boyfriend_27_m_of\/)\n\nFirst off, my thanks to all those lovely people that replied to my original thread. \n\nI never expected so many comments for my fairly insignificant issue.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI went ahead and did it. Monday evening, it was just the two of us at my place, pretty much like any other night when he slept over. Except when I 'accidentally' had my phone slip from my hand and got off the couch to get it so that I could get on one knee and propose to Peter. \n\nHe was at a loss for words. Then he started laughing. Then he left the room for a second while I was looking confused, still on one knee and with the ring in my hand.  When he came back, he got down on the floor with me and asked me the same thing, with a ring in his hand! I don't doubt we looked very silly when we both started laughing. Then we tried to put the rings on each other's fingers at the same time, which led to some more silly shit, but all in all, it was great. \n\nApparently, he'd been carrying the ring with him for the past five months. He wanted to originally propose for New Years eve, but didn't manage to get the ring in time, so he waited for another shot at it. The rest of the evening went perfect! \n\nYeah, we had to throw out the food left on the table in the morning, but hey, the night before was totally worth it! \n\nI waited until Wednesday, so we could both get out the news to our families and friends that we were now officially engaged to be married, before I hit him up with my gift. We talked a lot on it, and eventually he asked me to for a few days to process it, as it was a fairly big deal to answer to in the moment. I made sure that he knew that I didn't give a damn about whether he got the degree or not, and if he wanted, I could give him a full language course as an alternative gift, or even for us to travel and stay abroad for several months so he could immerse himself in another language completely. \n\nWe were spending the night over at his place yesterday and he gave me his answer regarding the gift.\n\nWhile he was really, really appreciative to the lengths I'd go to help him fulfill one of his dreams from his youth, he said that ultimately it was just something of a passing fancy back then and even now, with all the expenses paid for, he didn't really want it or need it. One of the primary reasons why he didn't want to go and officially study at a university is that he thought that would probably prove taxing on our relationship and he didn't want that. Studying another language is all neat and good, but not at the expense of the life we've built together or the life we would have in the future. \n\nThe language course idea was also neat, he said, but in the end he thinks it would be more enjoyable for the both of us if we took that extended trip abroad. That said, I don't think we'll be doing all that much for learning the lagnuage. Mind you, won't bother me none :)   \n\nSo that's it then, folks. No 4 years of studying, no delays on the wedding. Come this winter, Peter will be my husband and I'll be his wife!\n\nGod, my head's still up in the clouds and there's a part of me that can't really believe this is happening. I've never been more happy! \n\nTo all the galls and fellas from the previous thread, again, my thanks! \n\n**tl;dr: I proposed, he proposed back, we both said yes! He declined my offer of fully paid tuition fees for studying at university and the language course idea, and said he would much rather spend time with me abroad, just the two of us! Getting married in winter, so we're going to combine the honeymoon with the trip.**","40":" hey everyone!\n\nSo a week ago I (M24) stopped talking and with four of my long time buddys (M23-25). We have known each other for around ten years now but I moved to a different country so we only keep in touch via gaming.\nIn the last few years we were gaming together almost every day and a bit of mocking here and there was pretty much normal but it suddenly got way worse towards me. \n\nI don't really have a lot of money and I don't earn anything because I'm taking care of my father who has cancer. When I finished school, I never looked for a job but helped in the house and  with my little sister. My father is much better now and I've been searching for work for a year now but it's really hard with such a big gap in the history. My Friends know this!\n\nBecause of that of course I'm not able to afford any new games or any new hardware which leaves me left out a lot. This wouldn't be a problem for me if my friends wouldn't constantly mock me because of it. It started off as a bit of fun but with the time it got a lot worse. Because I sometimes had lag or couldn't afford a newer game or pc they mocked me To a point where they refused to play any games with me and just started all rounds alone (with me listening to it in voice chat).. and they started insulting me calling me a poor shit and making jokes how i will soon sleep on the street and eat junk.. that wasn't even the worst thing they told me too.\nI told them to stop multiple times but they just called me a crybaby\n\nAfter that has been going on for a few months I decided to just delete them and never talk to them again. This was not an easy decision scince they were pretty much my closest friends  but I couldn't take it anymore. \n\nTwo of them have been messaging me on phone and asking what's wrong and if I wouldn't have money for the power bill or what.. I now blocked their numbers as well\n\nNow im kind of sitting here alone and have no one to play with and I'm asking myself if I overreacted and if im acting like an Asshole. Thoughts? \n\nI'm sorry for spelling mistakes English is not my main language \n\nTLDR\n\nMy friends constantly mocked and insulted me for not being able to afford new games or Hardware despesite knowing my situation -i deleted and blocked them. AITA? \n","41":"Original post: \nhttps:\/\/m.reddit.com\/r\/JUSTNOMIL\/comments\/58cvp5\/fmil_needs_our_room\/\n\nA couple days ago he finally got ahold of his mom and she said she was just as annoyed by this whole situation as we were. FFIL was trying to look out for her apparently and he was going crazy. She kept saying that this whole thing doesn't matter to her and that she doesn't want a week full of awkwardness over a bed. I mean part of me believes her but she had to have said something about the stairs to get him going. Idk it was weird but his dad was really the one making things ten times worse. She told us to tell him that she'll get our room just to make him be quiet. (I don't agree with this btw, he's a grown man and should know that things don't always go his way). I still don't trust her.\n\nLater that day my fiance said he wanted to call his grandma (his dad's mom) and get her opinion. (I wasn't a part of the convo just listening to it) He tells her everything I wrote in the last post and that his mom doesn't care about which bed she gets. She somewhat agrees with us but goes on this tangent about how I need to be respectful to his mom and when his mom comes she is queen of the house. If I can't grow up and be nice then I should go live at my parents house for the week. We aren't married so I'm not as important as anyone in his family. I'm just his fiance. Needless to say I got upset, lots of crying. At one point in the convo I told him to stick up for himself. As soon as he did that his grandma said that what he was saying sounded like it was coming from me and not him. That honestly made me sad. She was basically saying that he never sticks up for himself so when he does it certainly couldn't be coming from him. This family seems to be okay with people acting out and it's okay as long as they're an elder. I give everyone respect and it was insulting that she would think i was going to be rude to his mom. I wouldn't have bought her a fucking Roku if I was being mean. I am respectful but if you don't deserve to have respect I can certainly say something about it. I really love his grandma, she had been the most accepting of me but this just killed my vibe for her. She also kept saying that he owes his mother so much for everything she's done for him. Last time I checked a child shouldn't be burdened like that. She makes it seem like everything he does in his life need to be for his mom. Screw that. He didn't choose to be born and definitely not to these people. I feel like his family is toxic but maybe that's just because I'm in so deep in this.\n\nThroughout this I've talked to my parents and sister. They have been amazing. My mom talked to my grandparents about it and they are on my side 100%. My grandma got mad and I have never once seen her get even a little irritated. So that felt really nice to have support. My parents took my fiance and I to lunch yesterday. They gave us a lot of good advice and made us see things from both sides but they agree with us that we were handling it very well. My dad kept telling us that we needed to start setting boundaries and soon. That's what he did with his mom. Telling her not to make him choose because he would choose my mom. I'm so thankful for them, they are truly the kindest people ever. My mom kept offering to buy anything else that we might need for her even though we all know she doesn't deserve it. \n\nI am so glad I have a fiance who has been choosing me over this craziness. He has been comforting me when I'm sad and has been angry when I've been angry. I am almost a little glad this happened because it showed that we could get through this weird craziness without turning on each other.\n\nAlso his dad wants us to get a prenup. Fuck him. We have talked about it before, not that it would really be filled with anything. If my fiance wanted it I would get it. He's been burned before and only wants to protect what he had prior. What we've built together is ours. Anyway I am offended that his dad said that. He shouldn't question my character, I should really be questioning his. If we get one it it will never be any of his business!\n\nThanks again for being there for me you guys! It has been so helpful. You guys have given me confidence and have made me laugh through this shitty time. \n\nTl;dr she's staying in the guest room but everyone sucks","42":"Hi everyone, I am a mom to one son and I have a very tricky and sad problem on my hands.\n\nMy son left his iPad at my house the other day and because my we both have the same model, I had to click around to make sure it was his and not mine.\n\nThe first thing that popped up was a website that he apparently had joined to try to restore his foreskin.\n\nNormally I would have just said oh okay well it\u2019s not mine so let me turn it off.\n\nWell - I made a decision when he was born to have him circumcised (his father was absent) myself.\n\nSo my heart sank when I read his forum posts about how he resents me for doing this to him but that he will never be able to tell me because it will break my heart.

I love me some pistachios so in the cart they went. Later that night I'm sitting on the couch watching TV in the dark when I get a hankering for some hard work followed by salty nuts in my mouth. Good thing I had just purchased the perfect snack for that. I grab the bag and get crackin'. After a few I get a weird one, it was a little bit soft and had an off putting taste. Sometimes they get burned or whatever and don't taste right so I thought nothing of it and kept chomping down. I got a few more bad nuts and thought to myself, damn Wonderful is off their game they burned all of these 'stachios. Then I bite into one and its also soft, but this one had a really weird \"hairy\" texture and an awful taste. I spit it out and finally decided to turn on the lights. I examined the remnants of my spit out snack and I see what looks like a spider's nest inside the pistachio. I break it apart further and to my surprise(or non-surprise at this point) a small worm looking thing that had been living in there, baked to a crisp. I started opening more nuts and examining them in the light. About half had these dirty little fuckers embedded in them. By my estimation I had eaten approximately a handful of baked zerglings thinking they were just burned pistachios. After much vomiting, I did some research and apparently they were likely navel orange worms, a field pest that infest pistachios. I was thoroughly grossed out and still cannot eat pistachios, but at least it seems that eating them isn't harmful.  \n  \n[This isn't my picture, but it looked very similar to this](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/hkvbv1462ery.jpg)  \n  \n  \nTLDR; Ate pistachios in the dark, got more than I bargained for and ate a good amount of baked worms.","44":"So I'm in my English class and we're discussing contemporary hip-hop. The issue at hand was Rick Ross' 2013 scandal in his song U.O.E.N.O. The lyric in question was:\n\n&gt;Put Molly all in her champagne, she ain't even know it  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain't even know it\n\nI laughed, and the immediate reaction from my class was that it was inappropriate and that I was finding humor at the expense of encouraging date rape culture. I didn't even attempt to explain myself because I've learned over the years that when you're in a hole, stop digging.\n\nAllow me to explain myself here. I sometimes forget people aren't in my head. I wasn't laughing because the lyric was inherently funny. I was laughing because the lyric was so fucked up, it was ridiculous to me that an \"artist\" from a major record label would ever get that lyric to post-production. Like I'm assuming there was a listening party before launch. There's probably a sound engineer. There's probably a board or committee who sees projects through from start to finish. The idea that this shitty lyric made it through every quality control checkpoint was just hilarious to me.\n\nIn my head, I was imagining Rick Ross sitting at a desk with a pen and paper, scribbling \"Put Molly all in her champagne, she ain't even know it, I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain't even know it,\" and thought, \"Man, this is a good idea.\"\n\n**tl;dr:** TIL don't laugh about rape in school, even if the context is appropriate in your head.","45":"So a little background first...\n\nMy MIL turns her nose up at drinking. As far as I know, her reasons for this involve strong traditional Christian values, growing up without alcohol, and viewing it as a irresponsible, dangerous, unhealthy habit. 2\/3 of these reasons are hypocritical because Jesus drank wine and she engages in other unhealthy habits (mostly related to her diet). I don\u2019t think she grasps the concept that people can drink responsibly and not everyone who drinks is a raging alcoholic. For example, she had serious concerns that I was still drinking when I was pregnant. Anyone who knows anything about me knows I\u2019m a social drinker and I cut that out of my life immediately and easily just like most educated, moral 20-something women. \n\nIt\u2019s always disappointed her that my husband and I are social drinkers and we don\u2019t always go to church on Sundays. Our lifestyle is different than hers and it displeases her.  In the past she has actually berated me like I was her teenage daughter in regards to us responsibly drinking on a weekend get a way with the family. She actually said to my face \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be drinking if it\u2019s possible you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d Not that it was even any of her business, but we were using multiple forms of birth control at the time so again, we were drinking RESPONSIBLY. She also pressures us into going to church regularly even though we are grown adults who chose to be involved in our faith in other ways. Both of her sons will be the first to agree that she is very opinionated and closed-minded. \n\nI dread going to visit my husband\u2019s family 2.5 hours away because I feel so awkward spending a weekend in their small, musty, dirty farmhouse house in the middle of nowhere. They are very dry, traditional, simple people. Time just drags on for me while I am there.\n\nI\u2019m not clear on my MIL\u2019s house rules for alcohol. There was one time that my MIL\u2019s out of town sister brought wine to a holiday being hosted at my MIL\u2019s and wasn\u2019t an issue at all. My MIL even tried some and laughed about it, saying \u201coh my, my joints feel...kinda loose now...he he\u201d while weirdly repetitively shrugging her shoulders.\n\nSome more background...\nI work 2 jobs, my husband and I have house projects, we\u2019re raising our first child. It\u2019s few and far between that we get a weekend to have time off work, spend time with family, get help with our little one, and get to relax. \n\nI\u2019m bringing a potluck item to a family picnic at my MIL\u2019s and would like to also bring a bottle of wine or some small alcoholic beverage(s) to enjoy a couple drinks. \n\nTL;DR : \nAnd now the questions for you guys... \nDo I deserve to relax in the way I prefer (with a little wine) on a weekend like this? \nAm I entitled to bring my own beverage? \nDo I need to ask permission ahead of time? \n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t about just one weekend. If it was, I\u2019d just not bring my beverage of choice to make things easy. However, this is about every future family function\/ holiday at my in laws for the next many years to come in which I am using my precious weekends off every now and then to travel and visit them. \n\nDisguising my drink isn\u2019t something I\u2019ll do because as a 28 year old that just feels so ridiculous and the drinks aren\u2019t worth even a small amount of effort to do the disguising ","46":"A couple months ago, in the early part of the year, my husband and I bought a lovely older home. It was affordable, needed a bit of work, but nothing too difficult. I'm the primary breadwinner though we both worked.\n\nLast month, my husband quit his job because it was too stressful and we agreed that he could stay home for a bit and work on the house over the summer while applying for new jobs and finding a better fit for him. He was coming home angry and irritable every day and we calculated that my salary is enough to keep us afloat for a little while without depleting our already exhausted savings (see: bought a house earlier this year). I figured, sure, his emotional well being was worth more than having money to buy everything or hire contractors. We can delay some of the fixes on the house or DIY. But some stuff was in progress and has to be completed.\n\nOn to the actual problem. It seems like every time my husband gives me a \"task\" to do related to planning around the house renovations I fuck it up. I try to carefully check my work. I try to plan ahead and foresee any major issues. But I just can't seem to get it right. I'm costing us extra money. I'm delaying all the work because I've miscalculated the volume of whatever we needed today. \n\nI. Fuck. It. Up.\n\nEvery time.\n\nAt least it feels like it. (I'm certain I'm not, but my depression is making it incredibly difficult to come up with examples where I've done okay at anything.)\n\nMy husband has gotten increasingly angry at me for these mistakes and I keep telling him that he needs to either help me check the numbers or just do it himself but he insists that I need to \"learn\". All that keeps happening is that I now have no confidence in making good choices anymore and get anxious and afraid about even expressing an opinion because I don't trust my judgement at all.\n\nSome of it is unreasonable, some isn't. I picked an exterior painting company (with his input) and they've delayed on us because of bad weather. This isn't my fault, I don't deserve to be snapped at about it. But I also calculated how much soil we'd need to fill some holes in the front lawn and put in the wrong numbers, ordering far less than we'd need. Totally my fault.\n\nAnd now I don't want to go home because I know he's going to yell at me again because I made another mistake and while I know it's just that he's frustrated, I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nHow do I fix this? How do I stop making this rookie mistakes?\n\nTL;DR: I make a lot of mistakes, no matter how much I try to avoid it with regards to home renovations\/purchases and my husband is reaching the end of his rope with me. How do I fix this?","47":"A little backstory, I\u2019m 20f, my sister is 29f and a single mother of two non-verbal severely autistic children, a level of severity in which it\u2019s doubtful they\u2019ll ever even have limited functioning in society even with full time therapy. She divorced their father about 5-6 years ago and the children are now 9 and 10. Their disability is intensely severe and I work full time as a caretaker to assist in their upbringing and daily needs. I have stated multiple times that I don\u2019t want children now, and don\u2019t know if I ever will, partly because I\u2019ve seen how severe some disabilities can be and don\u2019t think I would be mentally or emotionally capable of handling the worst case scenario. \n\nMy sister loves playing the \u2018what if\u2019 game and today she\u2019s been asking me if I love my niece and nephew and trying to figure out how I can say I love them if I\u2019m not willing to care for them in the case of her death, and kind of insinuating that I\u2019m an asshole for not being willing to do so. I do love them but I\u2019m mentally exhausted each and every day I leave work just after a few hours of being around them and their extremely demanding needs. Being in a caretaker position has brought about extreme increases to my anxiety and depression that I\u2019ve struggled with for years. \n\nIn the case of my sisters death I feel that I have no right legally or otherwise to take care of her children when her ex-husband has a good paying military job and a wife that stays home everyday raising his other two kids. Legally the children would go to him as his responsibility, not me, a struggling college student living at home with my parents. \n\nTL:DR AITA for telling her that her children aren\u2019t my responsibility and that me loving them doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m willing to sacrifice my life and future for a lifelong obligation of raising and watching over them?\n\n*Adding an edit- some of you have expressed your concern for my mental health in a job I dislike, thank you for that! I do want to ease concerns by explaining that I\u2019ll be leaving the job and finding a new one in a different field this fall once I complete my bachelors degree. I took this as a temporary position for the 2 or so years I needed to finish the degree as it pays higher than most jobs I could find. My sister knows of my intentions and gives me mental health days when I ask, so it\u2019s mainly just the status of \u2018aunt\u2019 that has given her preconceived notions and hope that I\u2019d step up for the children despite what I\u2019ve told her in the past.","48":"I typed out the full backstory to my post in JustNoFamily. TLDR: My husband and I met and got married very quickly; a mystery disability I had before the marriage derails our plans, makes me almost an invalid, and, without a diagnosis, messes with my head; and D(at this time, damn)H complains about how hard this is on him to his mother. \n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JUSTNOFAMILY\/comments\/alaasy\/is\\_my\\_mil\\_a\\_justnopart\\_one\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JUSTNOFAMILY\/comments\/alaasy\/is_my_mil_a_justnopart_one\/)\n\nOther things that my DH complained to his mother about in this time included my spending habits. Keep in mind that during this point in our marriage, we fought about how I was wasting money by buying staplers, because when are we ever going to staple anything? We don't need printer paper, we can steal it from his work-etc. To be fair, I also bought plenty of art supplies, because this had become my outlet and my therapy. DH did encourage the making of the art itself, and my volunteering. This becomes important. \n\nMy MIL is still pleasant to me when I see her, which is not often as she lives in another state, and I hope that she sees how unreasonable DH is when he complains to her at least once a week. DH is at this point going through depression and we act in concert to try and encourage him. She comes to visit and it's fun. However, she keeps asking me why I can't get a job. Why can't I work from home? I wasn't functional enough to work from home at this point, or go back to school, and school had been tainted horribly because of the trauma associated from having to leave due to my disability. I kept trying to explain this to her, but she persisted, dismissing my trauma and using the \"plenty of people do it\" argument. If I could volunteer, I could work, right? It felt like talking to someone who was over-privileged and a bit clueless, besides hurting.\n\nThen my MIL comes to visit our new condo. I was very much looking forward to sharing our new home with her, as her previous visits had been pleasant, and I was honestly proud of how it looked. But she was filled with disapproval from the minute she walked in. Where was DH's influence? she announced, in the home full of furniture we made mutually decided on and he had arranged. We had mutually decided to turn the dining room into a study\/library, because we always ate on the couch and didn't really entertain. DH was the only one leaving the house regularly at this point, and he wasn't very social with his colleagues. My parents had actually tried get us a dining room, and we had turned it down. But the minute she started asking where the dining room table was, so we could entertain, he started nodding his head, and throwing me under the bus. She disapproved of the partition in our enormous living room where my art supplies were. She disapproved of the fact that we usually slept on the futon in the living room which also served as a couch because it was better for my back. And there was my husband, nodding along with her suggestions, and then implying I had made those decisions-when we had made them together. Though things are very different now, I still feel hurt and betrayed by both parties for what happened. I felt betrayed by my husband's either lack of communication or need to agree with his mom, and by her for dismissing the home we spent most of our time in and any non-traditional manner we arranged our home. By her implication that I was supressing her poor baaaaby. \n\nBut maybe DH's complaining at the time caused this. Maybe I should let this go. He's genuinely changed(I'll go over this later)-maybe I should give her the benefit of the doubt. But how quickly he flipped on me-why did he have buttons like that installed? \n\nIt's not the last thing she's done that's made me suspicious. Stay tuned for part 2. \n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","49":"Background: This friend is my fiance's childhood friend. I have known this man for 8 years, and he is in a relationship with my friend...as a group, we consider each other as \"family\". Due to my busy schedule I have not seen this group of friends in about year. This occurred at a small birthday party for a mutual friend with about 10 people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone had a few drinks or shots at this party, and later in the evening everyone broke up into pairs or trios just hanging out. I was in the living room, singing karaoke by myself. He comes into the room and we start having a conversation and somehow get to the topic of my weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriend: \"You look different\"\n\nMe: \"Yes, I know I have gained some weight since the last time I saw you guys\"\n\nFriend: \"Oh well it's good weight, you are more....curvy\" (He's sitting really close, btw)\n\nMe: \"heh heh \\*chuckles awkwardly\\*, no no it's just the outfit\" (I move over to the other sofa)\n\nFriend: \"No, I don't think so.\" short pause... \"I think you would look like that naked too\"\n\nMe: ............\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get quiet after that comment and start singing again to escape the situation. I don't know how to process that comment. In the 8 years that I have known him he's never made a comment like that before or made me feel uncomfortable at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe comment stuck in my head the next day, and it's been a week since that happened. I want to brush this off and just forget about it, but I really don't know why this comment is stuck in my head. I've also asked myself once or twice if I should mention this comment to my fiance and my friend or if I should just brush it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. I felt uncomfortable with the comment, but is this a big deal?\n2. Do I tell my fiance or friend (the guy's girlfriend) about this comment? (He didn't make a move on me or anything, I just found this comment...strange).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR:\n\nFriend made a comment about my body, when I attributed it to my outfit, he said that \"I think you would look like that naked too\".","50":"Nora [25F] and I [26M] have been in a relationship for close to 4 years at this point, and our relationship has been great, but that is not the focus of this post. Nora has known her friend Helen [24F] for about 5 years, but they weren't particularly close until about 2 years ago when they reconnected. I became acquaintances with Helen shortly after I started dating Nora, and got to know her a bit better after Nora and Helen reconnected. All of us have a mutual friend named Eve [25F], who is particularly close to Nora and I (easily one of our closest friends). \n\nSeveral months ago, Helen started dating someone she met through a dating app named Nick [25? M]. All of our mutual friends, especially Eve, made an effort to be open minded to Nick but after meeting him, pretty much everyone came to the conclusion that he is a very unpleasant person to be around. Without going into too much detail, he has no social grace at all, has yelled at wait staff before, is openly bigoted towards certain groups, and lacks a sense of personal boundaries. It got to the point that several people, including Eve, approached Helen with their concerns quasi-intervention style. At first Helen seemed like she would take these concerns to heart but eventually decided to stay with Nick, even when several of her friends made it clear that their friendships with Helen would be strained or minimal if she continued to date Nick. \n\nThis came to a head about a week after the initial \"intervention\", when Helen spoke in a group setting with the friends that raised concerns about Nick, in order to give her perspective and let people know her decision to stay with Nick. Helen got very personal in what she said to Eve specifically by attacking her insecurities and bringing up Eve's history of mental illness and using it against her. While we were not present for these meetings, we heard about them in detail independently from trusted parties that were present, and both Nora and I are really disgusted with Helen's behavior. Nora in particular has told me that she doesn't think she would be able to get over Helen attacking someone's mental history. \n\nNow to the more immediate problem. Nora and I are engaged, with our wedding date set for later in the year. While formal invitations have yet to be sent out, we have sent out save-the-dates to both Helen and Eve. While Helen has approached us to let us know that she was cooling a bit on her friendship with Eve, Helen seems to think that we are not aware of what has transpired since we were not present. At this point in time, both Nora and I are uncomfortable with the prospect of having Helen at our wedding, or even staying friends with her, for multiple reasons. To complicate matters, she was previously moderately involved with wedding planning (she went wedding dress shopping with Nora), and has expressed a lot of excitement and interest in further involvement with the wedding planning. While we have already decided that we will be approaching Helen to uninvite her, we're not quite sure what's the best way to approach such a touchy and potentially volatile situation. We figured that it should probably be in private and not at our home, but aside from that, what is the best way to proceed with the disinvitation? \n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Fianc\u00e9e and I need to uninvite a previously close friend from our wedding.

Really Martha Stuart looking, and quite cheesy. \nWithout thinking I open the hole in my face that to this point in my life holds no real purpose and make the noise, \u201chaha remember those shitty little wooden decorations that we would hammer into the ground every year?

So break out the popcorn ladies and gentleman we are about to begin our cinematic excursion.  The next three installments will solidify the fact that I indeed have the most horrific wedding story. Okay maybe not the worst there was no chair throwing or naked coupling but it was damn close to being that bad. \n\nSatan has thus far had an opinion on everything.  However, criticism is the only thing she has contributed to this wedding.  At least until this point. As we begin seeking our wedding party she demands that we use our nephew as the ring bearer.  He is two and cute so we agree. Well, naturally we should use her friend's granddaughter as flower girl too, and the flowers?  Well, a lady at her church does flowers so naturally she already asked her and she has come up with some beautiful arrangements using calla lilies.  \n\nFirst of all I hate calla lilies I think they look like dicks. Second, she chose colors that clashed with my entire wedding. My colors were navy blue and silver and she chose red and gold because those were her wedding colors and they had been so pretty.  Also, she has quoted a price WAY out of the budget. So I contact her and she says that Satan has already signed a contract on our behalf.  Wtf?  So she agrees to change everything and discount if I buy the flowers since I can get them at a discount rate at my job. I personally love carnations so I order them to be dyed in my colors.  Crisis averted right? Oh seriously?  No. Satan flips out. How dare I not accept her help? She was doing me a favor and I was so rude. \n\nThis is when we begin having nightmares with the dresses.  First my dress which had been ordered a year in advance because it had to be hand beaded is still not in. My mother bought my dress as our wedding present.  I did not personally love it but I did not hate it and because I was not the one paying for it I wasn't complaining.  The bridesmaid dresses are a whole crazy issue. I had five bridesmaids. The first ordered her dress the same day as me.  However, six months later it was discontinued. Therefore the other girls had to find something else. Then they discovered after the first girl ordered hers that it wasn't available in all sizes.  I ended up telling them as long as it was floor length and navy blue I didn't care.  Of course Satan says we should go with short red dresses instead. I respond that if that I don't want them looking like working girls. \n\nThen comes the bridal shower.  Once again Satan is pissed the invitation does not name her. She calls the day of and says she is running late. She arrived an hour late and gave me a diet book so I would look good in my dress because you know white makes you look bigger. And she reminds me that only virgins should wear white.  \n\nNext installment Disaster and diversion \n\nTL:dr: Satan attempts to \"help\"","54":"Obligatory this didn't happen today. It happened in January.\n\nI drive a used 2003 Honda that has never had a working CD player. Coincidentally, my car's original radio broke so when I replaced it with another radio\/CD player a year ago, the first thing I did was see if it played CDs. It did and I left it at that.\n\nFast-forward to one month ago and I'm taking a road trip with a good buddy of mine. I was excited about my working CD player and I remembered his extensive CD collection so I told him to bring it along. He was skeptical but I reassured him that this was a different radio\/CD player, that it would work because I tested it, and that his CD wouldn't get stuck. Well, his CD got stuck. The CD player made a whirring noise, showed a red light I had never seen before, and displayed \"CD ERR\" prominently which is also something I had never seen before. Because of me, I had lost his beloved Star Wars soundtrack and being the terrible friend I am I quipped, \"Welp, that's a new take on the Last Jedi\".\n\nTo his credit, he was a great sport about it. We considered his CD lost, my CD player inoperable, and we played the Hamilton soundtrack off his phone (he's a big soundtrack guy, if you haven't noticed).\n\nNormally, this is where a TIFU ends but mama didn't raise no quitters. I still had the car's original radio\/CD player in my closet so I took it out, took it apart, and figured out how to get the stuck CDs out without breaking my electronics. I then removed my car's new radio\/CD player, did the same, and got the CD out. Three and a half hours later, I was happily texting my friend a picture of the CD captioned with \"Return of the Jedi\". I returned it the day before Valentine's and a truer love story hasn't been told since.\n\nEdit 1: The CD works! There's a bit of stuttering on track 20 but he says that might've been there before it got to me.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/faHLPoK\n\nTL;DR I convinced my friend my CD player didn't eat CDs. I was wrong and later took it apart to retrieve it.","55":"Throwaway for obvious reasons, but I'm not sure if bf is in reddit or not.\n\nI've been dating my boyfriend for 2 years and some change. He is a total sweetheart and he'd move mountains for me. I do truly care about him and know he loves me. We have plans to move in together soon, but I'm struggling with how I feel right now.\n\nWhen I say he's too nice, I mean he compliments me all the time. That sounds so awful writing out, but nothing feels \"special\" anymore. It's almost like it's a habit for him or he's going through the movements. Honestly, it makes me believe the compliments a lot less. He also is CONSTANTLY touching me, hugging me, grabbing, or kissing me. Now some people love that, but I can't stand it. I'm not a very touchy person and honestly it makes me not want to be around him. When I tell him I don't want to be touched he gets depressed and pouty and complains I'm not attracted to him or love him. When he gets into these moods I feel forced into comforting him or holding him even if I wanted space in the first place.  He also needs constant reaffirmation of our love, and asks me about 20 times a day if I love him, if I want to be with him, if he's the only one, if I'm sure we want to be together, etc. That's just exhausting for me, and it's now annoying when he asks, but even though I've talked to him about it, he won't stop.\n\nHe also always wants to spend time with me. Which is nice in itself but we hang out so much honestly I don't feel like we have as much fun anymore. I sometimes want to hang out with friends alone, which he is cool with if it's all women, but he constantly texts me and if I don't respond he may text me a couple more times. If I hang out with a mixed group(guys and gals) he gets upset he's not invited because it's no longer just a \"girls night\", but sometimes I still wanna hang out with MY friends alone since I see my bf daily. He used to have a lot of jealousy issues, and he has been working on them, but I'm pretty sure that's why he always want to be invited when guys are around. \n\nHe truly does so much for me, but it comes off as needy\/clingy\/smothering a lot. I don't even know how to bring this up, like, I don't like it when you're as loving as you are? When I talk about these things, he gets mopey about it and that's a turn off too. I would love advice on how to handle this. \n\n**tl;dr** my boyfriend is extremely lovey and kinda clingy and I don't like it, but I know he won't take it well if I tell him to stop","56":"So this actually happened yesterday.

I was relatively fit, I\u2019m young, I\u2019m athletic so I was pretty confident this lady can\u2019t outrun me if she decided to run with my phone. I asked her for the number she was calling, I type it in and handed my phone over to her so she can talk with her grandkids. I proceeded to step back but not too far away. Less than a minute later the lady handed the phone back to me and said that my phone wasn\u2019t working. The screen had red and black Chinese characters on it. I was very confused because it was working just fine just before I handed my phone to her and it was apparently factory reset. Apparently my phone (the Chinese One Plus 3) had a security feature in it that I didn\u2019t know about that will factory reset the entire phone if too many attempts at the fingerprint sensor is made.\nSo I had to go through the entire phone rest process again, had to hunt down Wi-Fi so I can reinstall all my apps from my google play account. I checked my contacts and only my contacts saved on my sim card were still there. All my photos have been gone except for the photos I\u2019ve taken because thank the lord for google drive. I lost a lot of files but it was okay, if I lost it then I lost it. \nThe fuck up hit me when I tried to access my Gmail account because I set it to ask for my personal Google Authenticator code whenever I logged in, I opened my Google Authenticator app and it had been reset too. I scoured all my files, plugged in my phone to the computer and did everything I could but the backup code screenshot had been deleted along with other files on my phone. I was still like oh well no problem I have another email I could use and I can always make another YouTube account. \nI\u2019ve been casually involved with Cryptocurrency for the past year and a half and put in a few hundred here and there. I\u2019ve had some highs and lows with cryptocurrency but the last I checked I had roughly $12,000 dollars in holdings on my crypto wallet. Because my crypto wallet is so important I set it so I would need to provide my Google Authenticator code every time I logged in but I don\u2019t have access to my Google Authenticator anymore \u2026 so effectively I\u2019m cut off from accessing my crypto holdings that I worked so hard to build up for. \n\nTL;DR I let a sweet old lady use my phone at the bus stop, triggered the fingerprint sensors too many times and factory reset my phone and my ability to access my cryptocurrency account.\n\nEdit: just want everyone to know im in the process of removing my google authenticator from binance. Process will take a week or so but i should have my moola back. It's been a wild ride.","57":"There is a hell of a lot of context so you're gonna have to stick with me here. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was around 12 but even before then my Dad and I weren't really that close. For the first couple of months after the divorced it was great! My dad made time to see me, he only lived 20 mins away and we were closer than ever. Then he met her. They met through mutual friends. She was a widow, 9 or so years older, and lived 6 hours away. At first I was really happy my Dad had found someone and immediately a couple weeks into them dating I met her. She made lewd innuendos in front of me about what they were going to do later, spoke over me and refused to eat anything at the restaurant I chose because she \"doesn't like Spanish food\". A month or so later I get a call from my dad saying that he had moved the day before to where she lived and, therefore, couldn't meet up that weekend. He told me AFTER he moved.\n\nCue the next couple of years of her passive aggressively hating me at any family event and me only seeing my Dad twice a year as she cut his contact time down with me. At one point (~15 y\/o) she made my Dad leave me behind at my niece's christening so I had to go around asking for a lift back from the church. My two half-brothers (from my Dad's first marriage) even staged an intervention to try and get her to improve her behaviour to me.\n\nThen I came out as a lesbian.\n\nI came out to my Dad alone when I was 16 and he said he was completely fine with it. The next day she calls me up and says things that still scar me to this day. I have been incredibly lucky to have never faced that level of angry homophobia again in my life but it was horrific. My dad let her say these things to me whilst he was in the room. I am very lucky that my half-brothers\/ other extended family just completely ripped into him and cut off contact with him and I built myself up again.\n\n3 or so years pass and I get a call from my Dad saying that she had passed away from cancer and that he now wanted to get back in contact. I talked to my brothers and they have both met up with him to see what the situation is. She left him penniless they got married (secretly) but she left nothing to him in the will. He has been burning through cash like crazy to impress her and now has no job prospects, no family, no money, and no permanent home (he has a house for the next 2 years but nothing after that).\n\nHe's getting older and I don't know whether I'm going to regret not getting back in contact with him. He seems apologetic but I don't know whether that's enough for me to forgive him.\n\nTL;DR homophobic step mum is now dead so dad wants to get back in contact but idk if I can forgive him.\n\nEDIT\/\/ he also tried to steal my savings a year and a half ago but luckily was able to get it all back before having to go to court ","58":"Background: So I used to work at a drugstore and before that I worked at a fast food joint, and a take 'n' bake pizza place, for a little while I was working at the drugstore and the pizza place both to make my ends meet. This last January I had a mental breakdown and kinda freaked out because I kept getting sick, then the local flooding was trapping me at home, then getting sick again, then getting flooded in again, and getting sick, and getting flooded in, you get the point. I had had to call in the last 4 days and when I finally did go in, as I was about to clock in, I just freaked the fuck out. So I quit. I had just started school, taking accounting courses because holy fuck do I hate the general public. I'm 3 weeks from the class ending. Obviously, I kept up with the school, and once it's done, I'm going to be looking for accounting jobs. I moved in with my ILs again on April 28th and it was going fine mostly. Also, my MIL is Bi-Polar and supposedly on medication and seeing a psychiatrist.\n\nBut then this morning happened. Technically also last night.\n\nMy MIL suggested I apply to PetCo down the road cuz she could get me an easy job there (I highly doubt it, but ok). Since I have a plan that my husband is totally cool with, I politely declined and explained I can't really work with the public cuz I had a mental breakdown, but was about to finish my accounting course and apply for accounting jobs. As evidenced by this morning, this apparently went in one ear and out the other.\n\nSo this morning, my husband and I are woken up to the lovely sounds of my MIL yelling into the phone about how I'm lazy and do nothing and I need to find a job or get on SSI and get a diagnosis cuz if I can't work, I need to be diagnosed.\n\nOk bitch, first of all, I am doing something. I'm going to school. Schoolwork doesn't take up all of my time. Second, I can work. Hence why I'm going to be looking for accounting jobs once my class is over. Third, I don't need a diagnosis because I know what's wrong with me and it's not what caused the breakdown (that was stress). I'm depressed as all shit, but being with my husband for the first time in 3 years has helped that a lot. \n\nAfter she's off the phone, my husband goes out and corrects her and reminds her that I told her I was going to school and that the semester was almost over and I was going to be looking for a job once that happened. They end up fighting because she's trying to defend what she said and straight up lies and says she told us that I needed a job to move in, which that was not the deal, then she tries saying that I needed to look for a job starting last Monday, which also was not the deal. Then she tries saying that if I don't have a job by July, we're going to get kicked out (FIL won't let that happen, everyone knows she's nuts). My husband stands his ground and reiterates what our deal was (paying half the bills, since it's him and I and MIL and FIL in the house). She then tries to demand more money and goes on about how she's gonna start charging us like we're tenants and charging us something ridiculous like $900 a month when it would've cost us significantly less to stay apart. I love my husband. I don't have to shine up his spine because he came with one! He flat out told her no. We had a deal, we're sticking to the deal.\n\nThe rest of their conversation is pretty confusing cuz she keeps getting off topic and trying to change the subject and he keeps dragging her back to what the conversation was actually about.\n\nMy thing is, as long as the bills get paid, who gives a shit? There was a long while when I was working and my husband (then boyfriend) wasn't and I got shit done and paid for. It wasn't a big deal, and it isn't now, and I don't see what the problem is considering I'm going to be looking for jobs soon. But I can't just yet cuz I need to finish this class. What is so hard to udnerstand about that? (Apparently everything!)\n\nTL;DR: MIL thinks I'm insane cuz I had a freak out and can't work with the general public anymore, tries to insist that charging us more than we agreed on is reasonable, and then backs off when my husband actually has a spine.\n\nEdit: and now MIL and FIL are fighting and she's telling him to go fuck me.... I hate my MIL....","59":"I was interested in going to an event with my boyfriend this Saturday. The tickets were $200 each, $400 total. I knew that if I let my boyfriend know the price he would tell me not to spend that much money on him and that the event would not be worth the price.\n\nI came up with the idea of telling him that my friend was selling her tickets to me at a significantly lower price because something came up and she would not be able to attend. My boyfriend agreed on going now, since the prices were much cheaper.\n\nI happily go on the event's website to buy the tickets, only to realize that the tickets were sold out, and the only ones available are  expensive VIP tickets.\n\nThen my boyfriend asks me if my friend has any extra tickets for sale, because he wants to invite his sister, who is graduating on this Saturday.\n\nRealizing that I can no longer buy the tickets at regular price and him thinking I have a friend selling me tickets for a cheap price, I tell him that it is fine if we decide to not go because he won't be able to invite his sister along. I was hoping he would call off the plans. Instead, he suggests I offer the tickets to his sister instead as a graduation gift so she can go with her boyfriend.\n\nI am left with two choices: Buy the expensive tickets for myself and feel resentment while at the event for spending much more than I was planning on, or spend that same amount of money on his sister's graduation gift and make him happy.\n\nI decided to buy the tickets as a gift for her. The worst thing is, I do not like his sister. I highly dislike her.\n\nWhat to do! Boyfriend already told his sister, and she seems happy and told him to tell me thank you. If only I checked the website if it was still on stock before lying.......yes, i can still request a refund.\n\nNow I know my lesson. No lies, no matter how big or small.\n\nTLDR; My lies led to me ending up spending more money than I wanted on someone I highly dislike.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Boyfriend decided he wanted the tickets for us to go. he took them back and now his sister is disappointed. i have created a mess. ","60":"My aunt owns a Cabin in the mountains, it's nice this time of year because it's close to ski resorts and has a very nice wintery feel. \n\n2 years ago my Aunt agreed to let my wife and I use it. Initially it was just supposed to be us 2. But as time went on and we were unable to find time to get away we missed the opportunity 2 Winters in a row. \n\nWord about the cabin got out to my wife's family and they expressed interest in possibly joining us if we ever decided to, or found the time, to go. \n\nI was fine with this. It was just me and her and her parents. Then her sister and nephew were added to the discussion without really asking me. But I was still okay with it because I love her family and we all get along well. \n\nSo we found a weekend to go and everything was looking fine. Then I find out that my wife's niece was also invited without asking me. I grit my teeth a bit simply because I wasn't consulted about it but in the end I was still okay with it. \n\nNow this trip has transformed from something that was just supposed to be my wife and I into her family trip to my family cabin. I'm okay with it. But a bit annoyed that my trip was \"taken over\".\n\nI was asked (I was finally asked!) if the niece could bring her new girlfriend (the romantic type. They are both 18.) To which I said no. I was not comfortable with that because this girl is a stranger and my wife's niece doesn't exactly have a great track record of making great decisions. \n\nI didn't feel comfortable bringing a stranger that I can't vouch for to my family cabin. \n\nAll of a sudden people are angry that I would deny her GF the opportunity to go and spend time with the family. And since the trip is a month away I have \"plenty of time to get to know her\" (their words). And \"it's only one person and we approve of her. It's not like she's bringing a bunch of people you don't know.  As if it's my job to go out of my way to vet the girl and test to see if she can earn my approval. \n\nAt this point I don't think I even want to go anymore. This whole thing has morphed into something that I don't recognize as the cozy little get away that I planned with my wife 2 years ago. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: Wife's family wants to bring a stranger to my family's Cabin and I'm not comfortable with it. Stranger is my wife's niece's new GF.\n\nEdit: because I've been accused of having a problem with her sexuality twice now allow me to clarify:\n\nI have absolutely no issue whatsoever with her sexuality and I have no idea where that sentiment comes from. \n\nI have a problem with her decision making. She wrecked my wife's car less than 6 months ago 6k worth of damage. Driving the car without permission or insurance. We got the car fixed and signed it over to my wife's mom for the niece to use on the condition that she would treat it with the respect that she lacked when she wrecked the car. She has proceeded to smoke and drink in the car (both activities for which she does not meet the age requirement here) and hot boxes it with her friends and girlfriends regularly. It's disrespectful and I don't particularly want that type of disrespectful behavior at my aunt's cabin. \n\nHer sexuality is a non-issue. I fully support relationships of all kinds. Gay, straight, bi, trans, whatever. You do you.\n\nEdit 2: my wife seems to be getting more \"hate\" than I feel she deserves so let me say this:\n\nMy wife fully supports my decision and is backing me up to her family. She is taking the brunt of the ire coming from them and defending me. She doesn't agree with my decision and would prefer I allow the GF to go, but is defending me all the same. She has my back in this whole thing. My wife initially invited her mother and father, and asked me for permission in that regard. And I was fine with it. It was at that point that my MIL started the invite train. I don't feel my wife has done anything wrong. She may be guilty of lack of confrontation towards her mother, but my wife is very non-confrontational so I don't fault her for that. \n\nWife has my back. ","61":"TL;DR: my mom had a heart attack, her meds made her crazier than usual, and she accused me of fucking her husband because I took a bath after work in the evening, then used her prior husband's molesting me to justify her suspicion.\n\nSo, when I was about 23, Ditchmom had her first heart attack.  She was a long-haul truck driver at the time, and it was very difficult for her to make the lifestyle changes necessary to reduce her risk.  So, naturally, her first heart attack was not her last by a long shot, and she was having them again within a few weeks.\n\nI'm told that heart attacks tend to fuck with the brain, and that a cardiac med cocktail of the intensity and volume Ditchmom needed would have *also* fucked with the brain.  I should, apparently, forgive her for the sheer *awful* she subjected us to because of that.  (Spoiler: I don't.)\n\nDitchmom's mental health had always been shaky.  I mentioned the TBI, the native Cluster B shit, and the history of CSA already.  So when her cardiac symptoms and medications started fucking with her brain chemistry even more, she was  not starting from zero.  A more normal person might have had some tactless or childish or difficult moments.  With Ditchmom, it was like somebody had opened the top of her head and poured straight evil in.\n\nIf anything at all about her day went some extremely loose definition of wrong, nothing could make her happy.  I once left a dish in the sink after lunch and was subjected to a top-volume screaming tirade that went on for ten minutes.  But even then she wasn't done: she was sulky and passive aggressive for the rest of the day.  OVER A DISH.  IN THE SINK.  WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PASTA SAUCE ON IT. \n\nOnce, Ditchmom halfway tore the house apart screaming that she couldn't find her keys, and I had the temerity, the absolute *gall,* to point out that the car keys she hadn't been able to find were in the exact same spot as always.  I shouldn't have fucking bothered, because that earned me a fifteen minute screaming rant about how soulless, evil, and selfish I was.  FOR FINDING HER KEYS. \n\nBut you're not here for the minor, day-to-day drama.  You're here for the shit in the title.  So gather 'round:\n\nAbout two months into the unending fucking nightmare that was my mother on cardiac medication, my dirtbag aunt got reactivated from the reserves and re-posted over in Djibouti.  That's a whole story in itself, but the upshot is that my uncle was alone in a house with four somewhat traumatized children, and since my mother was so very unsatisfied with living with me and her third husband, it worked out perfectly.  She went down to Florida to terrorize them for a few weeks, and her husband and I would stay in TN and be very, very fucking glad that she was gone.  It was heaven.  I went to work, I came home, I walked the dogs, I played my video games in peace and ate whatever I wanted and all was well with the world.  The husband picked up some short-haul jobs and we had a very pleasant time of not seeing each other, ever.\n\nI made the terrible, terrible mistake of taking a bath after a stressful day of dealing with the utter asswipery that goes on in an opioid-prescribing pain clinic.  Ditchmom arrived home just as I was getting out, so I greeted her in a bathrobe and helped her bring her suitcases into the house.  Ditchmom thanked me for my assistance and went upstairs to unpack, right?\n\nHAHA, no.  Ditchmom grabbed me by the arm and towed me to my bedroom on the first floor.  She shut the door and leaned in close, like LBJ or Kevin Spacey on *House of Cards*, and demanded, in the low, poisonous, hate-fuelled demon voice she'd adopted since her heart attacks:\n\n\"Are you sleeping with him?  Did you fuck my husband while I was gone?\"\n\nMy flabber was fucking gasted.  I said something like 'what no what the fuck WHY,' but it was incoherent because *what no what the fuck WHY*.\n\n\"What are you doing taking a shower in the middle of the day?\"\n\nOkay, record scratch: it was fucking 7PM.  A perfectly reasonable time to have a \"my day was stressful, I deserve bubbles\" bath.  I stared at her like she was crazy, and although she clearly realized how fucking irrational she was being by the embarrassed look on her face, she just had to barrel on.\n\n\"I mean, it's not the first time I've had to share a husband with you.\"\n\nAt which point, I lost my fucking shit.  \"YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUCKING BELIEVE ME,\" I howled, because I gave no fucks who heard us.  \"You didn't even fucking believe me about it at the time, and now you're using what YOUR HUSBAND did to me WHEN I WAS TWELVE as GROUNDS FOR SUSPICION?\"\n\nThat shut her up, and we were able to move along like it hadn't happened, which was really the best either of us could hope for, at least until I was totally done with her shit, packed everything I could carry into my car, and drove south to get the fuck away from her.","62":"This is a short one. And also my first post here.\n\nI work at a Motorcycle shop,  we have a service bay where we also do work on cars and trucks, but mostly its just friends, family and staff who get their vehicles done here.\n\nA few months ago I leant my Playstation 3 to the Mechanic since his Xbox barely works, and when it does his 3 kids are fighting over it.  Money was a little tight one week and I had recentley bought a PS4, And have a PC too.. so I just asked him if he wanted to keep it.  We agreed on a price, but then a few days later he remembered it's November, and we are in Canada.. and I hadn't had my winter rims installed yet,  so instead he offered to do my wheel and tire change for free as payment for the Video games and such. I agreed\n\nHe asked I come in early this morning so he had time to do the wheels \"off the clock\" incase he got called out first thing in the morning,  I didnt get much sleep last night, So I felt a -little- bit drowsy this morning.  I dragged my ass out of bed, got dressed, and beat it to work.\n\nPulled in the lot, there was a bunch of trucks all over the yard, and he was standing in the bay door area, talking on the phone and motioning for me to come in.  \n\nUntil Today I've had a spotless record with driving, I had to give it some gas to overcome the incline and the lip at the top of the ramp to get into the garage,  I came in a little too fast, and the way I came in, the car bounced and I bumped something on my undercarriage or bumper on the angle of the door lip.  My Co-worker made an \"ouch, that poor vehicle face\" and so did I... except I was more focused on cringing over the admittedly minor bump.. I forgot to move my foot.\n\nI floored it. On the gas pedal.\n\nLet's just say I stopped it in the nick of time.  I slammed on the brakes But had a split second panic because the car was moving so fast, it didn't stop on a dime, it was a RWD Car, so it seemed not to respond to the braking as I was still coming over a lip at the time.   Co-worker had to back pedal and if it had gone another foot I would have pinned him to the wall.  Put the car in park and I just opened the door , both of our faces were white as ghosts and I just sat there profusely apologizing.\n\nI logged on the Security system to get the video, but our cameras suck, they only take pictures like every second...  but here's a video too\n\nhttps:\/\/i.gyazo.com\/aff15efa9aac2e191beed1ec474245a9.mp4\n\nTL;DR. I hit the gas instead of the brake, bringing a car into a garage, and Almost fucking pancaked my friend against the wall.","63":"There was an after work event this week. A coworker was leaving for another job and we were going out for light food and drinks. I don't drink btw. I didn't give my husband details because he usually doesn't ask nor appear to care that I attend these occasional outings which usually end by 6-7pm. \n\nHere's kind of a text log to get an understanding of what happened. \n\nHusband 6pm: You have that thing tonight right?  Need dinner after?\n\nMe:  Should be out of there by 8 and fed, no worries about dinner. Times are estimates. \n\nHusband: Ok. \n\nNote the following I didn't see until the train ride home at around 11pm. \n\nHusband 930pm: Hey baby, everything ok?  What's your status\n\nHusband 1005pm:  All good?\n\nHusband 1030: Hey, give me a ping getting worried. \n\nMe 1033 (sent by asshole coworker): Hey buddy, chill the fuck out. She's in really good hands, I can assure you ;). \n\nI left my phone at the table and asshole coworker took it upon his drunk self to send that text. Yup my iPhone 4s is not password protected.  I didn't see any of my husbands texts because his notifications had been cleared when asshole coworker opened up messages. I saw it as soon as I got in the train and texted him immediately. \n\nMe 1105:  Babe, sorry that was not me!  See you when I get home. \n\nNo response from husband. \n\nWhen I get home he is in bed, I give him a kiss on the cheek and he doesn't reciprocate. I ask him what's wrong and he says he doesn't want to talk because he's afraid he'd say something he regrets. \n\nThe next day was totally ghosting. He finally approaches me tonight and says that he felt extremely disrespected and is suspicious of my inattention. He said he wasn't keeping tabs on me but making sure I way okay since most of these wrap up by mid evening. \n\nI profusely apologized and tried to defuse. He wasn't all that receptive. He said he's not sure what to think. He had total trust in me but thinks something nefarious must have been happening for this guy to have my phone and feel bold enough to send that text. Him and I, back and forth, no improvement. \n\nHe finally dropped a serious bomb. He says he doesn't know what to think. But he said that if there's any hope of him believing this was as I say (as actually happened) that I can't be in his words \"the same fucking room with that fucker\". No after work events, if there's a work meeting he wants me to notify HR that there's a personal conflict.  He's heated and said if I can't meet these demands then I can either look for another job or a new husband, my choice. \n\nEverything is happening so fast. I know he's over reacting, but he does have his reasons. I have bitched out the asshole coworker. Told him off and told him if he touched anything that belongs to me again I'm going straight to the police.  What my husband is demanding is not practical. \n\nI guess I'm asking if I should risk waiting this out for cooler heads to prevail. Or meet my husbands demands. Or if there's something I can do otherwise.  I am pretty sure he thinks something happened that night. I think if he was assured it is what I say it is he'd move past it, but I can see from his perspective it looks like shit. \n\nTl;dr: Out at a work function, running late. Husband was trying to get ahold of me to no avail. A coworker picked up on this and used my phone to send husband a text that seemed as if I was dissing him at the least, fucking around on him at the most. Need advice on how to proceed. \n\n","64":"So this happened earlier today over the course of about 3-4mins, some relevant background; I broke my ankle and a few toes (on opposite feet) weeks ago, my cast was removed 3 weeks ago so I\u2019m mobile and now down to using  one crutch, mostly for balance. \n\nThis has meant that my brother has been chauffeuring me around everywhere, including to and from work. He was running late today so I wobbled my way down to a supermarket to grab milk etc and told him to pick me up outside the store at the little pick up\/drop off point by the entrance.\n\nSo I was sitting on the bench outside the store when a wild MIL appeared, with her DIL and grandkid. I\u2019m not sure how old the kid was, I\u2019m no good at judging kids ages, but based on her stream of babbling, I don\u2019t think she could speak just yet. She was sitting in the little chair thing in the trolley and seemed to be quite happy. MIL was an older woman who was walking slowly but seemed to be fine.\n\nDIL parked the trolley and kid beside me and told MIL to wait here; she\u2019ll go get the car so MIL didn\u2019t have to walk across the car park. From what I got from the conversation; MIL had been moaning about her feet and wanted to sit down. DIL was trying to get her to sit on the bench and MIL was martyring herself. I promptly put a stop to all of that by offering the MIL my dry part of the bench and moving further away to lean against the wall. MIL didn\u2019t even look at me before sitting down like she\u2019d just been crowned.   \n\nDIL kissed the kid, told her \u201cmummy will be back in a moment, you be good for Granny and then we\u2019ll go for a fun ride in the car\u201d. Kid\u2019s happy and excited for car ride, mum disappears.\n\nAs soon as DIL was out of earshot the MIL tuned to the kid and said \u201cYou\u2019re such a bad little girl. See, mummy\u2019s leaving you here. She\u2019s gone without you. No car for you\u201d. Cue kid bursting into tears and *screaming* for her mum. I\u2019m not sure how much the kid understood of what the MIL had said, it may have been all or she could have just understood the \u201cno car\u201d part, either way it was a shitty thing to say to your grandchild (or any child tbh). \n\nI looked right at her and gave her the raised eyebrow look and some serious glaring, which probably gave away the fact that I\u2019d heard her. She completely changed her tune, loudly telling the kid that she was \u201conly joking\u201d and \u201cmummy will be right back\u201d etc. \n\nThis didn\u2019t really have much effect on the kid and she was working herself into a right state, so the MIL decided to take her out of the trolley seat.\n\nShe plonked the screaming kid on her feet then *turned back to sit on the bench*. Guys, this kid could have given Usain Bolt a run for his money. The moment she had her (not particularly stable) balance she made a run for it screaming for her mummy. \n\nStraight towards the road.\n\nThere was about 15ft between the road and me (still leaning against the wall) and about half that between the kid and the road. In the time it took for me to realise the kid was heading for the road and that MIL hadn\u2019t seen a thing, the kid had made it pass the bollard (there are bollards outside shops in the UK, I\u2019m not sure why but I have theories).\n\nI have *never* moved so fast in my life, I managed to grab the kid and make it back to the pavement before my ankle realised that a full sprint this soon was *soo* not a good idea. Neither of my legs were interested in supporting me after that so I just sort of crumpled into a heap on the pavement with this kid. \n\nThe next thing I know the DIL is there taking the kid from me, it was her car that she\u2019d run in front of.  \n\nDIL was crying, the kid was crying, I was crying (it fucking hurt) and MIL was *still* sitting on the bench. \n\nAnyway, I blame it on the adrenaline\/pain because normally I wouldn\u2019t get involved but I told the DIL *exactly* what had happened, all of it, even what MIL had said to the kid. When I left DIL was still screaming at her MIL.\n\n**TL; DR: MIL upset her grandkid while DIL went to get the car. MIL then released the kid who ran into traffic. I almost re-broke my ankle recapturing the kid.**\n\nEdit: I'm happy to say that this post actually has an [update](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JUSTNOMIL\/comments\/55vj9o\/mil_in_the_wild_youre_such_a_bad_little_girl\/). I'd like to thank everyone for their comments and of course for the gildings.\n","65":"Well I fucked up a few weeks ago but the consequences have followed me to this morning.\n\nI manage a dive bar and usually I\u2019m by myself during the week. As soon as we opened at 3pm, I had two incredibly obnoxious older men come in who were having a few drinks before a football game nearby. As I knew they were leaving and it was quiet I was pretty lenient with them. They made some weird creepy comments like \u201cdo I find older men horny\u201d as well as vaping in the bar, passing out on the table and requesting music (EDM when I was listening to Nick Cave...)\n\nOne of them loves the bar, like he thinks it\u2019s fantastic. He\u2019s the sort of older rich guy who just has an air of \u201cooh I\u2019m slumming with the young people!\u201d and asks if we can discuss booking his birthday here. I give him my email address as I\u2019m pretty sure he won\u2019t email, this isn\u2019t the kind of place where men like him have their birthdays. I have two email addresses for work. One is my personal one I use for live music, events, trade stuff and the other is purely for bookings. The booking one is also monitored by the owner in case I\u2019m away or whatever.\n\nHe\u2019s aware it\u2019s not my personal one but I manage to convince him it\u2019s just me who checks it so he\u2019ll definitely be dealing with me when he books.\n\nSkip forward to today, I\u2019d forgotten all about this and assumed the man had too.\n\nI woke up to several missed calls from the owner and when I call back, he is FUMING. He\u2019s telling me he opened an email where the subject was \u201cmy nickname\u201d and was filled with filthy shit and a picture of a hard dick.\n\nThe owner assumed that as he knew my nickname (I didn\u2019t want to give him my actual name) he was a friend of mine and I was using work property for some weird fantasy.\n\nThankfully he understood when I told him what actually happened and I still have a job. He\u2019s printed out the email, pic included, and it\u2019s now on our notice board.\n\nTLDR : today I fucked up by being too nice to a creepy old man and almost got fired.","66":"For once, this actually happened today.\n\nThe story, however, starts last night when I was scrolling through facebook and came across a typical click-baity article about how someone got a nasty eye infection because they didn't properly care for their contact lenses. I didn't pay much mind to the article itself, but figured I should refresh my memory on proper contact lens hygiene (I've been wearing contacts for years, and figured there might be something I might not remember from when I first started wearing them at 16).\n\nSo I look up proper hygiene and most of it is stuff I already know. (Don't sleep in them, don't lick them, etc.). But then I came across a suggestion that says the brand of solution you use should change from time to time so that the bacteria doesn't get used to it and overpower the solution's antibacterial elements. I just so happened to be extremely low on my current bottle of solution and figured I should heed the warning and make an quick trip to Target and buy an new brand.\n\nAs I look through the brands, this shiny box with a cool looking contact lens case pictured on the front stands out (as shiny things do), and it has triple-cleaning action! AND it's on sale for $3 off! What a steal!  So I buy it and merrily make my journey home to try it out.\n\nI open the box, and look at the cool contacts case that's inside. It has a small cage to keep the contacts in, which then is submerged into a small container which would hold the solution. \n\nI think to myself \"This is complicated and looks like it wastes a lot of the solution, I'll just use my old case instead!\" And so I do.\n\nNow comes what happens this morning: I wake up for work, call my girlfriend (who currently is in Australia) and go about my regular morning routine. I get into the bathroom and begin to put the right eye's contact in, and then suddenly, I feel the burn of a million suns. My eye feels like it welds itself shut. I drop my phone and scream in an agony that I could have never dreamed of. I lay on the floor, curled up in a ball, trying to pry my eye open to get the contact out. \n\nAfter what felt like an eternity of suffering I finally manage to rip the lens out and proceed to effectively drown my eye in water for about 15 minutes before the burning even begins to subside. I grab my phone to hear my girlfriend, who was terrified that I may have had a heart attack or something, breathe a sigh or relief. I then proceed to scan the box of the solution for any information as to what could have possibly gone wrong.\n\nOn the back of the box, in a red box, it reads something along the lines of:\n\"Solution contains 3% Hydrogen peroxide. Only use provided case, not a typical flat case. Let sit 6 hours before removing contacts from solution to let solution neutralize.\"\n\nI go to the doctor, and thankfully there's no permanent damage because I rinsed my eye so thoroughly. But I had to call out of work today cause I'm am idiot.\n\nTL;DR- I got new contact solution cause I was paranoid because of a facebook article. Didn't read the instructions on new solution (which contained Hydrogen Peroxide) and nearly blinded myself by putting my contacts in this morning.\n \nEdit: Grammar\n\nEdit 2: I swear the solution didn't have a red cap like a lot of you are saying. Just red plastic wrapping around the cap to first open it.","67":"Thanks for the support on my previous post, this community helps me keep my sanity. Again, I know my MIL is not anywhere near the cray cray that a lot of you have to deal with, so I really appreciate you hearing me out.\n\nSo this happened only a few months after SO and I started dating. Bear with me, there is some backstory. (Names have been changed for privacy)\n\nA few years prior to DH and I getting together, his parents went through a nasty divorce. I have heard bits and pieces from SO, FFIL, FMIL, and FSIL. SO reestablished contact with his dad a year after the divorce was done, because \"regardless of what may have happened, he has always been a good dad to me.\" I wasn't there for the NC period, but I have no doubt it was engineered by FMIL. FFIL is a really kind, funny, and awesome guy, he and I get along great. FMIL is not happy that there is any contact between SO and FFIL.\n\nAnyway, back to present day. SO calls me and asks if I will drive with him down to his house because he was worried about his roommate, \u201cAaron\u201d, who hadn't shown up to work (they worked the same job, opposite shifts). So I picked up SO so that he can keep trying to call his roommate.\n\nHalfway there, SO and Aaron's other roommate, \u201cBrad\u201d, calls. Brad beat us there, and found Aaron in his room, unresponsive. SO asked if he was breathing, and Brad broke down on the phone, and said Aaron wouldn't be getting up again. Brad says he is going to call 911, and gets off the phone. SO is obviously upset, Aaron was one of his best friends. Before we get there, SO calls FFIL because he works in law enforcement in the area that SO and roommates live. FFIL says he will meet us there. I am so grateful for how calm and collected that man was, it helped calm SO down a lot before we pulled in the driveway.\n\nIt was a long night of answering questions from the Medical Examiner, and officers who had responded to the scene. We were sitting outside for about an hour because they didn't want anyone in the house. Thankfully, FFIL was able to talk them into letting us sit just inside the door, it was cold that night. When it was all said and done, Brad went to stay with his folks, and FFIL followed us up back to SO's workplace, because Aaron's girlfriend had been trying to frantically get a hold of him (all three of them, SO, Aaron, and Aaron's GF work at the same place). FFIL was very helpful to SO when he broke the news to Aaron's GF, and was very supportive all around. Finally after a very long night, SO came back to my place to sleep. \n\nThe next day SO goes down to his place to meet Aaron's mom to let her in the house so that she can collect Aaron's pet lizard, some of his other things, and talk with both SO and Brad.  At some point before this, SO contacted FMIL, who freaks out on the phone, and says \"I'll be right there!\" Hanging up before SO can head her off.\n\nAll of them start working on packing up the house, because SO and Brad have already decided they will not spend another night in the house. Aaron\u2019s mother is keeping it together pretty well, a little teary, but not bad. She and SO get to talking about the night before, and she asks SO to thank FFIL for all of his help (FFIL spoke with her the night before and was helping her through the process of ordering autopsy, retrieving personal effects, etc). \n\nWell, FMIL hears them talking and proceeds to FLIP THE FUCK OUT. Screaming at SO that she can\u2019t believe he\u2019s still in contact with his father, why he would call him in the first place instead of her (she does not work in LE, and is not great in a crisis situation, obvi) and how he has betrayed her and all of this other bullshit, IN FRONT OF A WOMAN WHOSE SON HAS JUST DIED. FMIL storms out of the house and goes to lock herself in her car, sobbing uncontrollably and texting FSIL the \u201cdevastating\u201d turn of events. \n\nEveryone left in the house is dumbstruck for a moment. Then, in a moment that makes me proud, SO goes out there, pounds on the window until FMIL rolls it down, then proceeds to rip her a new asshole. How none of this is about her, or even about him, this is about helping a woman who just lost her son in a really terrible and tragic way. He also pointed out that she was not in a position to help the night before, FFIL was, and did so with flying colors. He tells her to leave because she is not being helpful or constructive, and is just getting in the way with her drama. Brad said he was dumbfounded, because SO almost never stands up to FMIL. \n\nTL;DR: SO\u2019s roommate kills himself, FMIL chooses to cause a huge scene to make it about her.\n","68":"Believe it or not this happened today and I'm still embarrassed hours later.\n\nMy friend had to get her wisdom teeth out this afternoon, and she asked me to drive her there and back and accompany her to her appointment because her parents are away for the weekend. Being the good friend I am, I obliged, even though the dentist completely freaks me out and the last thing I wanted to watch was my best friend getting teeth yanked out of her mouth.\n\nAnyway, her appointment was at 3 but we arrived around 2:45, and everything was fine. They strapped the laughing gas mask on her and she made me stand by her feet and give her a massage (I kid you not, this was her request). The oral surgeon began to yank her teeth out and I can't lie and say I watched, I kinda just turned around and told her everything was fine.\n\nThe surgery itself was going fine, all the teeth were out, and the oral surgeon said that he wanted to stitch one of them up. He was putting the stitches in and I wasn't paying any attention (stitches freak me out even more) and I noticed that there was a light stringy thing pretty close to the color of my friend's hair hanging way down by her leg. On instinct, I yanked it, thinking she had a hair stuck in her mouth while she was getting stitches. I thought I was doing her a favor.\n\nThought is the key word.\n\nTurns out I'm an absolute idiot and that it was the material for the stitches that were being sewn into her mouth, not a loose piece of hair. As soon as I yanked it my friend groaned and the dentist gave me a death stare (I kid you not) and asked me to leave and wait in the waiting room. Turns out I made it bleed a lot more than it was supposed to because of how hard I yanked the stitch. I'm just happy I didn't cause more damage than I did.\n\nMoral of the story, I'm pretty much an idiot and could've screwed up my friend's mouth just trying to pull what I thought was a hair out of her mouth. She thinks it's hilarious, but I don't think I'll ever be returning to that oral surgeon again.\n\n**TL;DR** Thought my friend had a hair in her mouth post-wisdom tooth surgery, turns out it was a stitch and I yanked it, making the oral surgeon think I was a complete idiot and totally embarrassing myself","69":"Well so me and a few dumb ass friends were messing around in an online game, 5 of us to be exact (sub names are: brad, Arthur, Joseph, Nathan, and OP for story purpose). Story begins a Month ago when my bud Arthur brought up the Genius idea to change my name to something super offensive (Because the 5 of us have a dark sense of humor). Gave me enough In-game currency to change my name and get a skin (because wasn't going to do stupid name change without some small benefit). He gave me the name theSchoolshooter and without hesitation I changed my name. Eventually other friends came online to witness the fiasco of what my in-game name has become. They instantly became amused and decided to join in on the offensive name change train. Brad Decided to be Blkschoolshooter, and Nathan changed name to Gayschoolshooter (mentioning in-game names because they will be changed shorty after post, and because context). My friend Joseph changed it up and named himself 44Mag my teacher, because reasons. And for a month long we just play in-game saying dumb and funny shit in all chat, (for the lols of course). Was all fun in games with the occasional \"Nice dank name\" said from enemy team or random teammates. Eventually after a few weeks later or more like a few days ago we actually played a game vs a bunch of people who were devs of the game that we were playing (OP and friends have the best luck). Immediately in-game with awkward vibes all around, especially in all chat. Told us they were reporting our names in all chat the sec the match started. &gt;Tosses friends under bus for comedic purposes in all chat in a last ditch attempt to lighten mood. Later in same match we continue to stomp them outright and steamroll rest of the game (probably didn't help our case). We laugh it off for the next few days till this night. Then fast forward to tonight in the AM. I'm surfing Reddit then suddenly out of nowhere in the middle of the night, a loud knock on the door. it was a cop asking for me (OP has the best luck). I freak out internally but keep my cool. Officer wanted to talk to me about some fuckery that was going on in online game (Commie Russian role play, bigot posts in all chat and names of course). Told us we were possible suspected threats and are being watched by FBI (btw officer was super chill entire time while i was shitting bricks internally and externally). At this point he begins naming off my friends in-game names including mine (not saying arthur's cuz wasn't on same level as others). I begin to let out a small chuckle because of the absurdity of the names being said but manage to hold it in mostly. Tells me to just be careful of what i say online and tells me he understands that it was all just Dark humor (huge relief). I go back inside with the conflicting feeling of laughter paired with a scare trip. Check my group chat with the partners in crime. Arthur trips in chat while other friends are shitting bricks because cop showed up to his house investigating. Now 2hrs later and i'm now posting this and still sp00ked. will post update if there is one, no guarantee .\n\nTL:DR. : Me and bunch of friends do stupid shit in online video game for a month with offensive names, and then eventually FBI investigates us and sends officers to each of us\n\nedit: here is proof https:\/\/imgur.com\/ABs68aC\n\nedit 2: one of our buds was forced to cut ties with us R.I.P.\n","70":"I was already having a really bad day today (credit fraud, illness, and just a generally stressful workday), so when I got home from work I decided to cheer myself up by working on my first cosplay, which I started working on just a few weeks ago. I had the wig for the cosplay sitting in a bag, unopened, so I decided I would wash it and try it on. Took the wig out of the bag, looked up a tutorial, and washed it in my bathroom sink, then wrapped it in a towel to dry. No problem so far. So while waiting for it to dry, I put on the hairnet that came with the wig, to see how well it fit over my actual hair. Almost fits perfectly, but my hair grows really quickly for a guy's, so it would either stick out in the back or create an unsightly lump when I managed to get it all shoved in there. So, seeing a nice clean pair of scissors sitting there right next to the sink, I decide to give my hair a trim, figuring that just cutting a tiny bit on my own couldn't go too badly. \n\nFU#1- my hair looks from the back as if it was savaged by a wolverine.\n\nI look in the mirror, grimace a bit, but think \"oh well, I've never really cared about appearances, it'll just be a minor annoyance for a few days\", and then, as I'm cleaning all of the hair off the bathroom door, I have a fantastic idea. My girlfriend got off work later than I did today, which almost never happens, so I decided that I would surprise her by dressing up in my cosplay ensemble (at least, the stuff that I had already finished of it) and chilling on the couch by the apartment door so she would see it as soon as she got home. So I start searching for one of the accessories for the cosplay, and can't find it anywhere. I start panicking, since I put so many hours of work into this accessory, and can't remember if I saw it when I cleaned the apartment last week and threw a bunch of stuff away. I start tearing the apartment apart looking for it, even opening and sifting through a few garbage bags in case I threw it away. \n\nFU#2- ransacked my entire apartment a few days before monthly inspections.\n\nNow my hair looks terrible and I know I will have a lot of extra cleaning to do in the 3 days before apartment inspections begin, but at least I have all of the parts of my uncompleted cosplay together. So I put everything on, including the wig, which feels a bit damp, but not too wet at all, and chill on the couch by the door. This gets boring after a while, since I've forgotten when my girlfriend is actually supposed to be home, so I grab my laptop and decide to watch some videos. With my really nice pair of gaming headphones. Completely forgetting about all the moisture still trapped in that wig.\n\nFU#3- shorted out a pair of fairly expensive headphones, making that the third pairs of headphones I've broken in the past 6 months\n\nSo yeah, my day could be going a lot better. But I still have high hopes for my cosplay!\n\nTL;DR: Ruined my hair, my apartment, and my headphones, all in the name of cosplay.\n\nEdit: haven't made many posts on reddit, edited slightly to make it more readable","71":"You can look at my previous post but I\u2019ll give a quick TLDR\n\nMy JN mom, Thorn, is one of those grandmas who lets her grandbabies do anything they want in her home and stuffs them with soda and junk during the duration of their visits.\n\nMy niece (6 y\/o) was jumping all over her couches. I totally understand kids will be kids and this is normal but since Thorn never warns or tells them anything, they jump on the couches in a dangerous way. They will stand on the arms and just flop themselves or things like this. \n\nWell my niece, while visiting Thorn, fell off the armrest and fractured her shoulder. My brother had to take her to the hospital.\n\nWell in my last post, I talked about how while my niece was in the hospital, she STILL allowed the kids to jump all over the couches and didn\u2019t tell them what they were doing was too rough and dangerous. I kept telling the kids and Thorn that one kid was already in the hospital and maybe they shouldn\u2019t be playing like that anymore... but that went no where. \n\nANYWAYS\n\nThorn was receiving pics of niece while she was in the hospital getting X-rays and getting a cast. Thorn kept sharing these photos to the fam text chat with tons of emojis and words that expressed how heart broken she was. Similar to this:\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd my poor ________\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\nShe continued to send pics of niece all night and during the morning she shared another pic and Thorn wrote \u201cNANA\u201d in BIG letters on nieces cast and bejeweled it. It was huge and it seemed like she just wanted to show off that she was the first to sign the cast and it will be hard to miss since she added a bunch of little sticky diamonds to her name. \n\nIt just felt like although it was part of Thorns fault, she turned it into a way to get attention. Like she cares about niece sooo much that she kept updating the family chat with pictures and sad emojis. Also, that fact that she wrote her name so big on nieces cast. \n\nYesterday my SIL was back home from her trip and in her Mother\u2019s Day pics with her kids (niece), niece had her cast in a black sling so you could not even see that huge \u201cNana\u201d \ufffd\ufffd","72":"I'm a guy who is a huge geek in my sophomore year of college. Nearly 4.0 grade point average, and a big-time calculus nerd. I'm not fat or anything, but I do have a bit of a belly from never going to the gym, ghost-white skin, and I have what my friend Ashley calls a \"cute bubble butt\" she says I'm \"hiding\" under my khaki pants all the time. So I have body-conscious issues too.\n\nI live at home with my family currently. And had a day off from school with everyone out of the house at work on a Tuesday at noon. I was having a new videogame delivered to our house, and was just out of the shower around noon when I thought I heard something at the back door. I figured I would just run to the door, grab it real quick, and run back in.\n\nWell, I underestimated my awkward geekiness. As I opened the door and hurried through it, my towel caught on the chair and I tripped and stumbled forward outside. Suddenly the door swung back, hit my white butt, and I was now locked in the backyard BUTT-NAKED!!!\n\nAfter standing there panicked and red-faced wearing nothing but my glasses for what seemed like forever, I knew what I had to do. The spare key was under the potted plant in FRONT of the house. So I tip-toed like a spy, bare as can be, all the way around to the front of the house. And it wasn't there!!! So I tip-toed my naked ass to the backyard again, hoping to shield my white bod with bushes.\n\nI then realized the key was actually moved last month to the garage. I had exposed myself to the front of the house for no reason!\n\nWith absolutely no cover in the backyard, I then had to steel myself, take a deep breath, and go streaking naked across the backyard to the garage to grab the spare key, and streak back. \n\nIn the middle of my run in all my glory in broad daylight towards the key, I turned to see our attractive 45 year old female neighbor with the biggest smirk on her face, drinking in my every movement of my run, and every jiggle of my bare butt, as I scampered into the back door to hide my shame.\n\nIt was so embarrassing (I'm blushing as I type this), and if I told anybody I knew, family or friends, they would just laugh their heads off imagining their nerdy friend naked as a jaybird running for his life.\n\ntl;dr Virgin nerd locked himself out of his house naked because of carelessness, and my hot neighbor saw it all.","73":"Miffled Mrs Bennet: my mother. On the subject of babies, she lives for them. I think she wanted a bunch of kids in the hopes that she would have mini Miffleds: just a few humans in this world that understood her. So 100% of her \u201ctime\u201d went into her kids. (Did your eyes get squinty too, after reading my previous posts?) She has no friends, and no hobbies. She has her kids. \n\nThose kids aren\u2019t babies anymore, and they certainly aren\u2019t mini Miffleds. She really did try. I heard a lot of whispered, \u201ctrain up a child the way they should go, and they won\u2019t depart from it,\u201d while growing up. \n\nThis takes us to today, or, the last seven years, really. You see, SO and I have been trying for kids for a year now. We will have an appointment for further testing soon. I want this kiddo SO BADLY. I come home and cry if I spend too much time with my friends kids. It\u2019s bad. \n\nI\u2019m also terrified of Miffled and the rabies that will set in the minute I give in and tell her I\u2019m finally pregnant. I read all the advice here. I\u2019m saving up all that advice. \n\nAnd, for your Llamas, here are the cringeworthy bits from Miffled over the years: \n\n- After the dissolution of my child marriage, I vowed never to marry again. I wanted kids though, and stated I would adopt around the age of 30. This trigger Miffled Rage Monster Mode. She only wants NATURAL GRANDCHILDREN. Don\u2019t worry, she will pray for the right man to come along, so don\u2019t adopt any time soon or that man will never accept me!\n\n- my 27th birthday card was actually a letter to tell me that she was now ready for grandchildren. She told me to wait when I was in school, but now I\u2019m out of school. So I can let go of that advice. Because now I\u2019m 27. \n\n- I made a lie of omission, such that she would think I told her I was sterile. That birthday card was just too much. I even explained to all my younger siblings my genuine worry about not being able to get pregnant after years of poor adherence to my BC without one pregnancy scare over the years. They grey rocked her when she asked, confirming her worry that I was sterile. She stewed for months over it, until word vomiting to Dad. Turns out she thought that our emotional distance would be rectified once I got pregnant. Surely I would understand her and come to appreciate her viewpoint once I had kids of my own!! I\u2019ll finally need her!\n\n- Miffled and Dad just sold the family home and bought a new place in town on the lake.  They didn\u2019t downsize. Why downsize when the grandkids will need room? (I\u2019m the only sibling who is financially and age appropriately ready for kids. I\u2019m several states away)\n\n- At brother\u2019s wedding last month, the topic came up while all of us were in the hotel hot tub. (Middle Sister later fessed up that she was trying to see how red Miffled\u2019s face could get while in public.) SIL and Younger sister doesn\u2019t want kids. MS wants her doctorate and 8-10 years before kids. You could see the red turn to white once that hit her. If I\u2019m the only grand kid giver, and may or may not be sterile, and am traveling around the world so often........WHERE WILL SHE GET THOSE GRANDKIDS. \n\nTLDR: Miffled and I both have baby rabies. I\u2019m a little depressed, but it\u2019ll work out eventually. Miffled is probably more depressed because she birthed a pack of trolls. ","74":"When I met my now husband he told me he was in the middle of a divorce...which I found out this week was not completely the truth.  He wasn't in the middle of a divorce the divorce hadn't even started. But there was a break in their marriage because he had moved out 4 months prior to us ever meeting, so when I met him he was what appeared to be a man living alone, while trying to iron out all the complications of a divorce. They had a kid together so it also seemed logical that he was in contact with his ex during this time, and spending time at the house. Turns out she was still under the impression that their marriage was intact, that the move out was just him needing some space for the time being and he strung her along for those 4 months he was living on his own, as well as an additional 2, almost 3 months, into our relationship. They would make plans together (he would cancel last minute because he was with me) She would try desperately to be a good wife to him (probably hoping he'd come back) send him I love you text...to which he'd respond back with a \"love you too\" or the dreaded \"luv ya\" She'd offer to make him breakfast before work or dinner after work to get him to come by the house...sometimes he would go most of the time he wouldn't. He was pretty much using her while he tried to figure out what he wanted. And there were other things like we took a weekend trip about a month in, and had one of the best weekends ever, we still talk about it to this day...and he had sent her flowers during that trip. Probably because of his guilty cheating conscious. \n\nWell one day social media does what social media tends to do and it got him caught up. He never used Facebook but did have an account, which made him tag-able. We went on a trip with his friends and during that trip his friend tagged him in photos of us together, his mom commented on the photo pretty much calling him a POS for what he was doing to his family. I was like WHOA...what am I mixed up in? He had told me before his family had turned on him and did not approve of his divorce so he had pretty much cut them out of his life, so again I had a reason as to why his mom was so irate over seeing him with someone else. And again, divorce is messy so none of it seemed that suspicious. Well it turns out that was the incident that actually ended his marriage, because THAT is when his ex actually filed for divorce. \n\nFinding all of this out actually made things much more clear for me, I was always treated like I broke up their marriage but I always thought I had nothing to do with it, from my perspective they were done months before I ever met him and were just handling legal things. That was not that case. \n\nSo here is my dilemma now, what do I do with this information? There is:\n1) do nothing, it was so long ago, there is nothing to gain from it. We have such a great marriage and relationship, what's the point? I was really mad when I found out and now I don't know how I feel. I,too, have been in limbo in a relationship, where things are done but you're too scared to pull the trigger, so you just end up being a shitty person till the other party has had enough of you.\n\nOR\n\n2) Bring it up. He was technically cheating on me too. There are so many moments in the beginning that are now tainted or would have never been had I known the truth. I would never disrespect another woman or a marriage like that, and yet I did. And because of the position he put me in, I had to take years of being treated like scum by his family. And I also wonder, had he not got caught, how long would that have gone on?\n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Without my knowledge I was the other woman in my husbands first marriage, now I'm wondering what I should do with all of this information...bring it up or let it die?","75":"Finally a place to discuss this! Backstory- I moved in with my SO when I was 18 and he still lived with MIL. MIL would still invite his ex over once in a very blue moon- its my SO's only ex. They dated five years and ex basically grew up in MIL's house even though they arn't really cut from the same cloth and didnt particularly love each other. MIL is a power house, self made, very ambitious and smart. Ex is a lifetime waitress, self proclaimed gamer, sleeps life away and immature. \n\nI played my part well and told them both if they wanted to see her from time to time I completely understood and all I asked was to be told before hand. I'm the opposite of jealous or possessive, even tried to help ex out every once in a while from afar. Until several months into relationship she was still texting him somewhat inappropriately and I then let everyone know I was uncomfortable with her in all of our lives, being that she used them for money and other things. \n\n2 years into relationship I find out SO had been sexting ex for 6 months or so. She sent him a lot of dirty pictures and he sent her a lot of money. We spent a year fixing all of our much deeper issues that had led to that, he made it up to me, etc etc. \n\nSO and I both told MIL what had happened as a way to say its time she cut his ex out of her life. She basically laughed it off, so I told her very seriously what a deep and complicated effect that betrayal had on me. How very very important to me it is that the ex be cut off. \n\nWe are now 5 years into relationship and MIL still WILL NOT LET GO OF MY SO'S EX. Any time I bring it up (once every 5-6 months) MIL tells me I need to not be jealous or that I am obsessing over the past. This girl has had 2 marriages since she dated my SO, she has her own MIL to lean on. My MIL justifies it that she has 15ish dogs and needs someone that knows them well to watch them while she travels. However she doesn't travel anymore and ex is at her (my family's) house 2-5 times a month. I was never this person before.. but now knowing that that vile, lying, user of a person is buddy buddy with the future grandmother of my children, that she kicks her feet up in my old house, that she even occasionally sleeps in my old bed drives me up the freaking wall. And MIL thinks I'm crazy for letting it drive me crazy. \n\ntl\/dr MIL turned me into a person I never used to be by keeping my SO's ex ( who he basically cheated on my with) around 5 years later. ","76":"This is double barrelled; let's take this step by step. Also, tl;dr below.\n\nOne, I feel like lower budget films are a lot more enjoyable. Personally, I think too much money ruins the movie \"objectively\", because it signals too many hands in the pot and too many people messing with the end result. Call me a purist, but I like it when the film is directly translated from the director's and screewriter's (sometimes the director is also the screenwriter, but not always) minds. \n\nMy favourite movies have terrible budgets, but they compensate elsewhere. Locke has a gripping plot and a fantastic moral. It also has a very unique setting. Low budget does not mean terrible effects and \"boring\" movies all about the story (a lot of people seem to hate movies that emphasise on the story). Moon was visually fantastic on a one mill dollar budget. Both Sky Captain and Cloud Atlas did fantastic with their budget considering the scale. The former was challenged with fresh technology, the latter had almost 4 hours of runtime to produce. Both were spectacular.\n\nThere are many more examples.\n\nLet me move on to my next point, which goes hand in hand. A lot of the budget gets carted off to pay J Law, or Will Smith, or whomever. For this reason, most low budget movies I see have pretty obscure actors, or better, kind of well known actors who're in it for the experience.\n\nLocke featured Tom Hardy, who played Bane, Mad Max, and soon, Venom. Yet the budget for Locke was an abyssmal 2 million. Nightcrawler featured Jake Gyllenhaal, but ran on 8.5 million. And Buried starred Ryan Reynolds, but survived on a 3 million budget. \n\nHere's my summary.\n\nLow budget movies are often better, and these movies may contain actors that are less well known, or well known actors not like themselves (I didn't recognise Will Smith in Concussion, as an example), but I don't feel discouraged.\n\nPeople always say \"who tf is in this movie\" or \"wtf this looks low budget af not watching this\", but they're really missing out on good, wholesome films.","77":"I'm almost 16 years old, and for about 3 years now I have this rule with my parents that if I want something other than basic food on the table, a place to sleep and clothes that my mother or grandma don't want (from time to time), I have to buy it myself.\n\nThe problem is that in my country the only job a teen can really get is giving people leaflets during events, and it takes you forever to have enough money to spend on stuff. I tried to make it another way, by drawing portraits of parents' friends and family. It wasn't much better, and took a lot longer, but allowed me to do it without it colliding with school hours.\n\nAfter 3 months of working practically every day, no social life, and a minimal amount of sleep, I finally was able to buy my first mobile phone (Samsung Galaxy S7).\n\nWhen it arrived, I was so fucking excited that when unpackaging I dropped it on the floor. The screen wasn't exactly scattered, but it had a small purple dot at the side. For the next two hours, I watched as the dot was spreading, slowly covering the entire screen until everything went black.\n\nI still don't believe it. Thought that I could maybe go and repair it somehow, but it's even more expensive than buying a new phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Unfortunately I won't have my money back, I talked to a guy from the company who sold me the phone and he said I clearly damaged it myself so yeah...no refund for me. But the good news is, I will be working part-time in my friend's parents' cafeteria, so in a few months I will hopefully be able to buy another one, from a more verified source!\n\nTL;DR: Got so excited with my first smartphone I broke it the same day I got it","78":"My wife is amazing and since this is anonymous and a throwaway I am going to brag. She is smart, sweet, sexy and smoking hot. She is an amazing mother and caring friend\/daughter\/sister. She is always going out of her way to make others feel loved and cared for and her cooking and baking would make you weep. Her picture should be next to nurturer in the dictionary. She is 5'6\/120 with perfect t&amp;a even after 4 children. She has a dynamite smile and a cute laugh that will knock the wind out of you. Even her name is beautiful - Samantha.\n\nThis isn't all bias either. Anyone who knows her would say the same. On the other hand people who see my wife for the first time think I am joking. No way a chubby, hairy mother fucker like me got a girl like that. I'm 6'4\/300 of muscley fat. I believe homosexual fellows would call me a bear. I've got a scar from my lip to mid cheek. I work a blue collar job and always have grease under my nails from some project I'm in the midst of putting together or taking apart. Oh and fuck you genetics - I am losing the hair on my head but the body is just as hairy as ever. For some reason Sam adores me.\n\nWe have a great life together though. She is a stay at home mom, we've got four great kids - had our last 4 months ago. Nice house. Two cars, two cats, two weeks of vacation and no lie we even have a picket fence. Thanks for reading so far. Now I'll get to the actual shit that happened.\n\nSaturday was a family BBQ for mother's day and I happened upon a conversation I wish I had never heard. Her aunt, cousin and a family friend were talking about how happy they were to hear she was done having kids. How they would have never guessed her life would be this way. How she wasted her education, she should be a reporter like she dreamed of. That she should be married to Todd. Fucking Todd, her college boyfriend, who is a goddamn weather man now. They don't know what she sees in me. (Her cousin called me a fat sack of crap.) Why she ever married me. How she could be happy playing suzie homemaker. Thats not the girl they knew. The ambitious go getter. She shouldn't have the life we have together - she should have a better life. With less kids and more luxury and no me.\n\nWell now I feel like a fat sack of crap. Never have these relatives ever given an inkling that they don't like me. Never has Sam ever given an inkling that she is unhappy. She did want to be a journalist and worked in print before we had kids but she gave that up to raise them hands on. I feel like shit over this and I don't know what to do or say about it.\n\nSam knows something is up. She knows I'm not my usual self and something is bothering me. She isn't pressing the issue but she has gone into nurture mode. She made my favorite dinner tonight just to cheer me up. Even made chocolate cake and homemade peanut butter ice cream. I wanted to cry. She's been extra flirty and flashed me some sexy panties and a wink while I was putting the kids to bed. It is all just making me feel worse. \n\nNormally I'd talk through any problem with her but what do I even say? \"Are you sorry you married a fat hairy bastard and had four kids with him?\" Do I tell her that her aunt was talking shit about her?\n\nI'm in my garage and I just can't go in the house. I feel like a useless jerk who ruined the most wonderful beautiful girl in the worlds life. I don't know if there is any advice to be given here I just really needed to get this all out. Feel free to tell me to man up or whatever. I just feel awful over this. \n\n   \n**tl;dr: Wife's family think she ruined her life by marrying a fat hairy sack of crap.**","79":"I love my mum. We haven\u2019t had a normal mother-daughter relationship (I lived with her for about 3 years and with other family for the 19 other years). But what I\u2019ve noticed is that she loves spending and giving to the point where it is way too much. She helps me out a lot where I need i.e. most weeks she will ask me for a grocery list, I text it to her and she buys what I need. I am extremely grateful for this but even in this situation she always buys a lot of extra things that I don\u2019t need (5 tomatoes instead of 1, or chocolates I didn\u2019t ask for). \n\nOther times she will guilt me into saying yes to letting her buy me things. One time we went to the hairdressers together but I was taking longer so she went shopping on her own for a bit, comes back and asks me what new iPhone I would like. I said no it\u2019s fine, my iPhone now works perfectly but she kept on insisting and I really didn\u2019t want to fight in front of the hairdressers. So I got a new phone when I did not want or need one.\n\nAnother instance was when I casually mentioned that I was planning on saving up for a new camera len. The next day my mum called me saying that she was already talking to the salesman and she needed me to hurry up and choose which one I would like. I felt trapped in that situation and just let her do what she wanted otherwise she would have gone that whole way over nothing and gotten mad at me.\n\nMoving on to the current situation. I have just finished my final year of university and have been planning for over a year to travel around America with my best friend Caleb to meet our other friend Lauren in New York sometime next September. However, my mum has been pressuring me and boyfriend to make him fly with us. She even said that she will pay for half his flight. But the thing is we have planned this as a friends trip and my boyfriend doesn\u2019t even want to go\/does not have the money saved up to py for half. She mentions it everytime my boyfriend and I come over and I think this is turning into an \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to fly to New York unless I bring my boyfriend to protect me\u201d. She has even joked about coming along with us too. \n\nI really need advice here as I never want to come off as spoilt or ungrateful and I definitely don\u2019t want to make my mum mad or have my friends have to thirdwheel with my boyfriend and I since we have been planning this trip for a long time. Also, my family is not rich. In fact, my stepdad is currently unemployed and there is no way that paying for my boyfriend to travel with me won\u2019t result in more debt. \n\nTLDR; my mum wants my boyfriend to come on a trip to America with my friends and I. None of us want this but she is pressuring me and saying that she will even pay for half.","80":"I'm on mobile, sorry for any formatting issues.\n\nSo it was my birthday recently and I'm one of those people that love to celebrate birthdays. Not to the extent of expecting a  \"birthday week\" or any of that silliness but I do get very excited. This year it was also special as I turned 21.\n\nNow my issue might be a non-issue but I still feel hurt over what happened and maybe you guys can give me some advice. I have been planning my birthday party for a while (just a gathering with my friends with alcohol and pizza, but still special to have everyone together). All throughout the planning a very close friend of mine, \"Sarah\", has helped me and told me she'd make a cake so I wouldn't have to worry about that too and she'd bring me a card game so I wouldn't have to buy it. Now, she offered those things and I thought she was being nice and I was grateful... Everything was great, I sent out the invites to my party a couple of days before so people could give me a heads up if they'd be attending.\nNo one declined. Awesome.\n\nThe next day Sarah sends out her own invites to a party the day before my party\/birthday to all people I invited. I was a bit taken aback and told her that I thought that may not have been the best idea to which she just replied that people [implying she was referring to me specifically] should be more spontaneous. \n\nThe week went on, I dropped by her party to be polite but said I'd be leaving early as I had stuff to set up for my own party, in response to which half the guests seemed very confused as they though we had just \"merged parties\" and mine wasn't on anymore. I was a bit hurt but assured people that I would still be celebrating my birthday. Now to how this came to affect my party the next day:\n\n- one of my friends said he couldn't come due to what sounded suspiciously like a hangover from the previous night. When I asked my other guests they high-fived for making him drink that much. \n\n- Sarah told me casually that she'd be late for my party (by 2 hours) and when she showed up she fell asleep almost right away as they had partied until way  into the morning. She didn't bring a cake either as she had served it at her own party. \n\n- nobody wanted to drink with me as they had done so excessively the night before, neither did they want to play games as they said they had \"played everything\" the night before. \n\n- The conversation mostly revolved around during inside jokes from the previous night that I of course didn't understand. \n\nBottom line? I feel my party sucked I  comparison to hers the day before. I wouldn't have minded at all had she had a party the day after, I would have happily attended. But the way it happened made me feel like she tried to squeeze her party in to get attention. \n\n*TL;DR: friend had a random party the day before my 21st birthday party with the same guest list and same Programme that we planned together, making my party be stale and boring in comparison. Am I right to be hurt or is this a petty issue I should just let go?*\n\nEDIT: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up. There's a lot I want to say but people seem to confuse reasons I give for her behavior with me trying to rationalize it. If I say the reason she did it was for attention, that doesn't mean that's okay. At all. It was a shitty thing to do, and the more comments I read (sorry for not replying to all of you but thank you for your time!) the more I know I have to talk to her.\nThe question was never whether or not to cut Sarah out of my life, I have had truly horrible friends in my life, so I know the difference between someone using me and someone just being shitty. When I said I've had to defend myself on previous occasions, it was all regarding her change since she got dumped. She's miserable and self-centered. The latter alone doesn't immediately make a bad friend, in combination with the former however it becomes toxic fast. I know that doesn't mean I have to put up with it all, I have enough problems as it is.\n\nHowever, she has supported me through hard times in the past, and I am not the ugly girl that gets to be with the cool guys through her. She's no Regina George, as people have mentioned. She's an insecure but outgoing 20 year old that lives by the rules of Instagram and let's the attention get to her head. Do I approve of that? No. Does it affect my life? Not until this incident, and I will not have another one like it  follow. Thank you for your replies. I'll talk to her when I see her next.\n\n","81":"Hello, I need advice. \nI'm 21 and work two jobs, both fast food and I hate it. A lot. \nI love this makeup store that I shop at and not to toot my own horn but I'm pretty great at makeup.

She's LIVID. Saying how everyone else is doing great and nobody ever calls her back and how she can't even afford rent. I brought up me offering her those jobs and she went off saying how she's tired of working food and how she wants to move up so I told her \"So do I, but I'm willing to do what it takes to keep my head above water and so should you.\" Then I told her to walk in and talk to them like I did and now she's saying she can't do it until tomorrow and other excuses. \nIt's pissing me off because I was so happy about this and now she's making me feel like I stole something from her just because she doesn't have a car or the motivation to do what I do. I'm debating on just telling them I'm not interested and recommending her instead. \n\nUpdate: Me and her have talked it out. She apologized for being jealous and told me it's due to her barely pulling $400 a month at her current job and that she sees me always going and doing and not worrying about bills because I work two jobs. I told her she still has so much to be hopeful for and that I'd do anything to help her out if need be because she's like a sister to me. \nI'm going to the interview Monday and ive already ironed my outfit and know EXACTLY how bomb my face is going to look. My dream is to be a cosmetologist and this is my foot in the door! \nI didn't think think this would blow up the way it did, thank you for the replies! \nBtw, I will try and get her a job there if I can, she deserves something like this to bring her up. \n \n\nTldr; My friend and I put in applications for the same job, I got the call back and she didn't.

Things went pretty well for first period, I was just a little bit on edge, but, during second period, things took a turn for the silly. I had sat in the back of the class because everyone else had already picked their seats. The teacher opened up with a pretty normal introduction to the class, but then suggested that we take all information down on the slides, because this is one of the most important classes of the year and all of the information will be in the exam...\n\nSo, I got to typing my notes and was focusing really hard, because even with a computer, I type slower than most people write and was having a hard time keeping up. Eventually, I started feeling light headed, but I figured I was just hungry and ignored it. Shortly after that, I started seeing spots in my vision and my head was pounding like a drum, but I still just figured maybe I was sick and would leave after class. But then, I started to feel the world spin, my hands and feet got pins and needles, my vision had become nothing but a tunnel and I felt like just going to sleep, even going so far as to laying my head down on the table...\n\n... it was at this precise moment I realized I hadn't taken a breath in well over a minute and in a panic, I gasped as hard as I possibly could.\n\nApparently, I gasped so loudly I caught the attention of the entire class, the lesson having stopped and the teacher started to approach me, visibly annoyed and said:\n\n&gt;T (teacher): I understand that this lesson is lesson is of great importance but have I really said anything worthy of a gasp, Mister P (me)?\n\nall eyes were on me, I felt like shrinking out of the room, and, not knowing what to say, I said the truth.\n\n&gt;P: No miss... I uh... I just forgot to breathe.\n\nand for the rest of my senior year, that was the joke of the class.\n\nTL;DR version: I got really nervous in class and forgot to breathe for so long I almost passed out\n\nP.S. I may end up posting more regularly on this subreddit, I have a... colorful history of poor choices and luck","83":"Hello reddit.  A few things are changed here for the sake of anonymity because I have no idea if my daughter has a reddit account.  Anyway my daughter Claire is transgender.  She has known this since the age of 11 and so have I.  We have been to a psychiatrist and she's been on hormone blockers for a few years now.  But she has only just recently at the beginning of the school year come out as a transgender woman to the rest of the world.  I'm so very proud of her.\n\nNow for some background.  Her father and I married young and we were separated when she was just a toddler.  I got primary custody because he was often in and out of jail for petty crime.  He got visitation.  One day a month and she visits his family for Christmas Eve and Easter because they are pretty religious and those are the holidays they like the most.\n\nFor the past few months, my ex Jeff has been 'too busy' to take Claire on their once a month bonding day.  She looks forward to it because she has a lot of fun and her dad basically spoils her.  I thought it was suspicious that this started as soon as she came out but Clair always sees the best in people.  I finally got confirmation this weekend that it's because he thinks I ruined our 'son'.\n\nHe says until I make Claire stop this nonsense that he is not coming to see her and that she is no longer invited to his family for holidays.  His mother called me as well and said that it's my fault she's like this because I raised her with no male influence.  I told her I wasn't the one who raised her son to be a criminal with no reliability.  I lost my temper at her and I regret it but I want to protect my daughter.\n\nClaire has been excited to see all her cousins since a lot of them are young and she loves playing with kids and babies.  She doesn't know yet that she has been uninvited because she is trans, or as they say 'a mentally ill freak'.  How do I go about telling her this without breaking her heart?  Or making her depressed?  I know we can always do something together that night but she loves traditions and they're important to her and it will hurt her to know that her family thinks of her that way.\n\nSorry if I rambled I just want to do this right.\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: My ex husband and his family banned my daughter Claire from coming to their Christmas because she is trans.  How do I tell her?","84":"This has been something that has been bothering me for a while, me and my partner have been together coming up 5 years and during our 5 years together she has never had an orgasm, we have tried everything and she's never had one, she's always reassured me and said our sex is amazing and \"better\" than her ex, and I've also always really enjoyed sex with her even tho I've never managed to make her orgasm, I always put it down to my penis size as I am only 4 inches long and just over 4 inches girth, however my girlfriend has always told me that size doesn't matter and that I'm a perfect size for her, we've talked about using toys like a vibrator before but she said she wouldn't be interested and she prefers \"real sex\" \n\nGetting to the main story my girlfriend mentioned to me a few weeks ago that she always fantasised about having a threesome with two guys (MFM) I said to her that I was up for trying something new, i was very surprised as my Girlfriend never seemed the type to be more \"adventurous\"  and I was curious as to why she suddenly wanted to have sex with another guy, she explained that it was always a big fantasy of hers and she was embarrassed to ask me, I was quite excited to try something new with her and especially a threesome, I said she could pick a guy (as long as it wasn't a friend) and I'd sort out a hotel and a date. \n\nShe eventually found a guy after a long search (a lot of fakes and people ghosting and some disrespectful) she asked me if I would be bothered if he was a little bit larger than me and I said it wouldn't bother me as she always told me size doesn't make a difference and it's skill more than anything, the date came and we got down to \"sexy time\" she got on her knees and started giving me a blowjob and I was extremely turned on, she was rubbing the other guy through his trousers and then pulled them down.. What flopped out wasn't something that was \"a little\" bigger than me but A LOT bigger, the dude must have been pushing 7.5+ long and 6 girth... Nervs started to kick in a little as she was enjoying blowing him a lot, however I kept in my mind that my gf had told me that size doesn't make a difference and it's more skill (but if that was the case why did she pick a guy with a large cock?) \n\nWe got down to PIV, taking turns doggy style as we had agreed and her taking turns riding us, she was extremely loud with him, a lot of eye rolling, panting, and a lot of swearing, she was quiet with me and seemed less \"into it\"  bear in mind as well my girlfriend is the type to be very very quiet during sex and very reserved! she didn't feel very tight during PIV for myself as well, I can only describe it as an extremely sloppy\/loose feeling, not something that I was use to, she pushed me to go deeper a lot and I obviously physically couldn't, half way through I decided to take more of a back seat and let her blow me while he was pounding her doggy...\n\nShe started arching her back, panting a lot and swearing and then WHAM, she had a massive orgasm, her first in 5 years and I was absolutely devastated  that I couldn't be the one to give her one, he finished inside of her 5\/10 mins later ( we had STD checks on him prior as we weren't taking any risks) she cleaned up and the other guy left\n\nWe had a massive argument after, I said to her why did she pick a guy with a big cock if she told me that \"size never mattered\" to her? And I said that I was devastated that she had a orgasm with this guy, she said to me  that she couldn't control herself and the orgasm just happened, I also was very angry that she didn't include me more in the threesome and again she just said she \"lost control\" and was extremely into the other guy, I asked her flat out again why she picked a guy with a large cock, and she shouted at me saying that she \"actually wanted to have good sex for a change\" she explained to me that she wanted to experience sex with a larger guy and the orgasm just happened, and she wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was, she said that recently she had been talking to her friend about her new boyfriend who was very well Endowed, and it had peaked her curiosity, she also explained to me that she thought that my size was maybe a problem why she was struggling to orgasm, something that she had always denied, I was absolutely crushed, and I now I have the image of that guys huge cock pounding my girlfriend to orgasm stuck in my head, it's not healthy for my mental state and I have recently been going in a bad state of depression.   \n\nWe haven't spoken properly in days and I'm not even sure how we can go any further with this relationship, if anyone has been In a similar situation I would appreciate some advice, I appreciate opinions from women as well!!\n\nTLDR: girlfriend told me size didn't matter, had a MFM threesome with another guy with a big cock and she had the best sex she's ever had and her first orgasm in 5 years.  ","85":"Long story short, my wife and I have been married for 2+ years. She's known I've always had trust issues after getting cheated on, which honestly left me jaded. In the past there have been fights between us, as guys she used to sleep with (she even recognized as not 'dating') have messaged her wanting a hook up. As far as I'm aware she's never indulged too much in talking about explicit stuff, but certainly talks to them\/ acts some-what flirty even after they've said trash about me, or she fails to mention me at all. In transparency I have been a bit nosy, and I'm at fault for that -- you're bound to find something bad if you look, and that is an invasion of her privacy. Regardless, the other night while I was watching videos on the computer with my daughter I see a notification for some message on Facebook. It didn't recognize who it was so I checked it out. It turns out it was from one of her close friends, and she was logged in. I then noticed towards the bottom and message between her and some guy, with the last message reading \"Thanks boo\". I could immediately feel the blood rushing, and my anger setting in. I read the message, brought my daughter upstairs, explained to my wife that I wanted to show her something, and brought her to the computer to see what it was. From there, I told her what I had seen, and I went through it line-for-line. The look of guilt and shame on her face was there, and she kept apologizing and asking if she should go. I told her I wanted to put the kids to bed, and we'll talk after. We did that, and afterwards I confronted her. I explained how although what she said at most was PG, the context and lack of regard for me as a person made me sick. Not only that, but she continued to flirt with this guy, and send pictures of our kids after he opened the conversation and continued to joke around about \"being a step-dad\", to OUR kids. To give some perspective on her, she's had a history of severe depression and is currently medicated for anxiety. She's also a stay at home mum, to our three kids, and I work full-time and also go to school full time. I think she feels nostalgia for when things where simple, and when she was a little more 'free'. I think sometimes it's one thing for your husband to value you sexually and physically is one thing, but sometimes you do need it externally. I don't at all think that justifies it, but I do think it's worth mentioning, as these situations are complex. I just wanted to get some of the sub's feedback on how to digest this, any advice, really just anything at all you have to say about this situation from a woman's perspective. \n\n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: a guy my wife used to sleep with messaged her, joking around about how she should divorce me, sent her a dick pic and how he would be a great step-dad. She continued to chat, indulged him, sent pics of our kids. Could use some advice on how to move forward after this.\n\nBelow are some of the things she said that were the most hurtful for me:\n\"Could you handle 2 kids?\" in response to him telling her to divorce me, \"I'm a good catch\", \"if you liked it, you should have put a ring on it\", how she missed the times they'd hang out together, and complimenting him on his looks, and how he should have no problem getting any women.","86":"This might be a simple fix, but here it goes anyway.\n\nI have a friend from college who is getting married next September. She told me about it over the summer in one of the few and far between conversations that we've had in the past few years. After college, she moved from Michigan (where I still am) to Colorado and I barely hear from her anymore. The thing is, even when she was still in Michigan, I hardly heard from her anyway. Which makes it weird that she would ask me to be in her wedding, let alone maid of honor. We've had many falling outs and getting back togethers, only to fall out again. I call her my fair-weather friend, because she only seems to talk to you when it's convenient for her. I have tried many times to call or text her, only to be ignored. Until she has some big news to share, then she suddenly reappears. \n\nWhen I found out she was getting married, I knew I would probably at least be invited. The wedding is in Colorado though, and between getting time off from work, the flight, the hotel, etc., I knew I wouldn't be in the best financial situation to go. Then she suddenly started calling me all the time (while I was at work or the gym, so I didn't pick up). When I didn't answer, she would text \"Call me, I have something to ask you!\" That's when my \"oh crap\" meter started going off. I knew she was going to ask me to be a bridesmaid (even more money I don't have). She finally caught me at a time I could talk last night and she asked me to be maid of honor. And I didn't know what to say. I wasn't planning on going as a guest, I was going to let her down gently as a bridesmaid, but the maid of honor? I don't know what to do. \n\nHelp?\n  \n  ---   \n  **tl;dr**: Friend is getting married and wants me to be maid of honor, except I don't feel like we're friends anymore and don't know what to say. Financial problems too, blah blah blah.\n\nEDIT: She did mention \"helping me out\" with the financial side of things, something I'm not comfortable with (I don't like when my parents give me money, why should I let her?). I am planning on telling her no, wishing her the best, and sending a gift when the wedding gets closer. A lot of you had some great suggestions on what to say, and I'll let you know how it goes once I talk to her again. ","87":"Obligatory, this didn't happen today. Let me take your minds back to the summer of 2016.\n\nIt was towards the end of June that myself and a group of my friends decided we would go to the party location Magaluf, in Spain. The first night we went out at around 11pm, little did we know this was an early start to the nights out there. We stayed out until around 6am and headed back to the hotel room.\n\nWe then went out the next night, and the next, and the next, and then one night, I commited a FU. \n\nAll I remember was knocking on my hotel room door. Opening my eyes, looking down, staring face to face with my flaccid phallus and unable to work out whether I was in a dream or not. I pinched myself, and it hurt.. so I used that as evidence to support the case of reality. I stood there for a few moments, banging on my hotel room door, figuring out what the fuck to do. I was completely naked, locked outside my hotel room on the 3rd floor of the hotel.\n\nI had a few options; wait for someone to open my door if I could wake them up, take the elevator down to the bottom floor or run down the stairs to the bottom floor where reception is. I didn't like the last options, so the banging continued. A few moments later, a security guard came up to the floor with a Spanish flag and the biggest fucking smile on his face. I wrapped the flag around myself and we proceeded to go downstairs for me to get a spare key.\n\nAs I was walking with him, I heard people laughing and smirking and making jokes and such. To be honest, Magaluf was probably the best place it could have happened as it was around 9AM (everyone would be asleep) and it's a party place, so things like this must happen all the time. I got a spare key, went back to my room and slept it out. The only reason I knew it wasn't a dream was the fact I woke up with a flag around me.\n\nI have an idea on what happened. At home in my bedroom, I have to stand up and walk out of my room, turn right and then there is the bathroom. The hotel room was laid out almost EXACTLY the same as my room, except the bathroom was on the inside of the door... not the out. I think I must have woken up (I sleep naked btw, it's so much more comfy!!!), my brain still asleep and in autopilot must have gone and walked out of the door to find the bathroom, realizing it's mahoosive mistake and then proceeding to slowly awake to the sunshine and laughs as it was making my hand knock on the door.\n\nI want to go back :(\n\nTL;DR: Got drunk. I sleep naked. Woke up. Slept walk outside of hotel room as it is the way to the bathroom at home. Locked self out naked. Rescued by security guard. Went to bed.","88":"I(21m) have lost all respect for my sister (26). \n\nIt started when she moved down to Columbus to attend CCAD for animation and failed her first semester.... and then decided she needed to introduce more stress into her life by buying a dog. A large, expensive, high-maintenance dog, an Afghan hound, saying she \u201cneeds\u201d a dog. \n\nThe next part comes when I\u2019m in Columbus on a visit to a medical center to have a speech issue addressed. My mom decided we should stop by my sister\u2019s apartment, and when we arrive, the place is disgusting. Not only is there trash *everywhere*, there\u2019s two birds in one cage, neither of which are even hers, there are particulates floating in the air. I know this sounds like an exaggeration, but I am 100% serious about this.\n\nNext, a few months later i find out she\u2019s short on rent. *Again.* And my mom has to pay for it. \n\nFast forward a couple more months, she\u2019s almost evicted for not paying rent, and my mom can\u2019t afford to pay it, so she has to start asking members of our extended family to give her money so she can pay it. \n\nSome other time along the way, I was forced by our mother to give my sister about $200 from *my* financial aid money that *I* need for *my* schooling to her. \n\nAnd then around Thanksgiving she visited, and I hear her speaking with our father about how she constantly stress-spends her money. \n\nOh, and this one\u2019s a little petty: She calls me a weeaboo for liking anime while she\u2019s simultaneously obsessed with Korean drama, K-Pop, going so far as to teach her dog tricks in Korean rather than English.\n\nI just try to avoid her whenever she\u2019s home for holidays because I can\u2019t stand her way of life, but my dad thinks I\u2019m too harsh. \n\nTLDR: I hate my sister because she:\n\n-bought an expensive dog while on a tight college student budget (Afghan hound)\n\n-lived in squalor(She\u2019s moved now, but I can\u2019t imagine her new place is any better)\n\n-has 0 financial sense, wastes money and then leeches off of other people in the family\n\n-convinced our mother to force me to give her my financial aid money\n\n-hounds me about an interest of mine while being unhealthily obsessed with Korea herself\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way towards her? ","89":"We live in a country where race is still kind of a big deal and she sometimes makes comments that I *thought* were satirical, e.g. \"All you want to eat is (ethnic food)\".  I always tell her to shut up because it's rude and we end up laughing at how stupid racist comments like that are, so I never thought she meant it. For what it's worth I'm bi-racial, half ethnic minority, half majority, she's ethnic majority.\n\nBasically I spilt food on the table a couple of weeks ago and she said, \"See, you can't eat properly with cutlery, because you're a (race-name) savage, you eat with your hands.\" I felt this was crossing the line a bit, I explained to her this sort of stereotype actually isn't funny, she said she'd stop.\n\nA week later I was out with an ex and she remarked that she didn't need to remember his name because all my exes, and myself, can be called by this racial slur. I said again this is not okay and she said she thinks she gets away with it because she's cute and it's funny to her. I said she should know I mind because I've told her before, and I've also told her I mind when other people do it. I also said she should stop because she complained a lot about people being racist to her when she lived in a white-majority country, so she knows how it feels. I told her I'm not mad with her but I won't encourage this.\n\nShe said \"okay, fine\", and since then I haven't heard anything from her in the past 2 weeks (we normally talk everyday). I'm not sure if I should reach out or just let it die? I kind of thought we were old enough that we could just apologise and move on, but her silence makes me feel like she isn't sorry, and I am wondering if I over reacted.\n\nTL;DR: Friend was racist even after I told her to stop.\n\nEDIT; I really appreciate all the comments. She has just texted me to ask how I am and I'm not responding while I think this through. I feel like a thorough apology is in order, if we can resume the friendship without resentment on my side.","90":"Okay, so, LTL FTP &amp; all that. Also on mobile, so apologies.\n\n(TL;DR: My mother stole a photo, identified the wrong child as her granddaughter &amp; it's driving me nutbars.)\n\nI am currently busting myself out of the FOG with my mother &amp; it sucks. All my life everyone has always told me how great she is &amp; I totally drank the Kool-aid. But recently she went waaaay too far &amp; my eyes were ripped open so now she's in time out &amp; for the first time in my life I am no contact with her (or vvvvlc? She's blocked everywhere but FB but I never respond to her on there. IDK.)\n\nSomeday when I have more spoons I'll type up the BIG THING that she &amp; SFIL did to force us to go NC, but for now, a small snack because it's kinda driving me insane.\n\nWe have a DD (5) &amp; DS (2). DD is in her first year at school (kindergarten) &amp; loving it!\n\nYesterday she &amp; her class did a recital for Veteran's Day &amp; it was crazy adorable. My D(arling)H is a vet &amp; he actually teared up during it. It was just that sweet.\n\nAnyway, I took a million pics, of course, but we don't like showing DD's face online (we did when she was a baby but now she's more identifiable so everything previously posted has been locked down &amp; we try to stick with pics that obscure her face now). So the pic I posted to my own, extremely locked down FB page was one where her back is turned &amp; she's excitedly pointing us out to her teacher.\n\nIt's totally adorable.\n\nMy mother, who doesn't understand what \"do not contact me for the foreseeable future\" means, tried to share the photo. I clicked \"ignore request\".\n\nSo of course she got the message &amp; backed off, right?\n\nHaaaa, no. Of course not.\n\nInstead she saved the pic, re-uploaded it TWICE &amp; each time SHE HAD IDENTIFIED THE WRONG CHILD AS \"her girl\".\n\nI had deliberately blurred EVERY KID but DD, but you can CLEARLY see the child she circled cannot POSSIBLY be her.\n\nFor one, DD has long, gorgeous brown hair. This little girl is blonde.\n\nTwo, DD doesn't wear GLASSES. The little girl does.\n\nDH thinks she's doing it on purpose to get a response. He still seems to have faith that she can't possibly be this stupid. I have my doubts. I feel like she absolutely COULD be this stupid &amp; it's driving me insane.\n\nAnyway, of course both photos have been reported. I'm waiting to see if they actually take them down &amp; then she's getting unfriended. (Which I should have done in the first place.)\n\nI'm just so disappointed in her. I guess almost 40 years of living in a FOG so deep it could be mistaken for Silent Hill &amp; suddenly stumbling out of it will do that to you.\n\n(Also we call her Beverly in front of the kids so if that name isn't taken, I'll just use it. Because there are way, way, waaaay more stories coming... unfortunately.)","91":"The other day I was seated in a restaurant beside a woman who had just become a grandmother. She was really nice, choosing to talk with me (who was linguistically handicapped), so we talked a lot about all kinds of mundane things. And as she was excited to talk about her family matters, we talked about her family matters. I heard, for example, that every woman, upon becoming a grandmother, feels and wants to behave as if the grandchild was her own child. She then lamented that she had to not show this urge to the actual parents and try her hardest to allow them to parent their child themselves. \n\nShe also told me that she really did not like the name that was given her grandson. And I mean she REALLY did not like it. To be honest, the name was a foreign one, rather rare, too, chosen because the child\u2019s parents liked an international celebrity (one I had never heard of though) with this name. I proceeded to tell her a story of someone I know having named their second daughter after the eldest daughter\u2019s best friend, and thus this very Scandinavian child ended up with a very Middle-Eastern name, totally out of the blue. The lady said then that yes, she also had named her daughter after an old friend of hers, against everyone else\u2019s wishes, even if the name in question was from a neighbouring culture and not her own.. and that actually she had started to grow accustomed with the grandson\u2019s name.\n\nShe originates from a culture where people show kindness towards their relatives and guests by infantilizing them and attempting to micromanage their lives, aggressively if needed, so I was rather impressed with her. She didn't say anything about having been told off baby-hogging or the like, but rather let me understand that it was all her own wisdom and own choice. Knowing the culture it's more than likely that she had had to deal with enough JustNoMilism herself before, and sworn to not follow the same path (which would explain the \"every woman wants\" thing..) I don't know, and I didn't ask. But I keep my fingers and toes crossed that she manages to keep the lid on her JNMILism, and may her daughter and son-in-law keep shining their spines and help(ing) her on her path if she tumbles. \n\nTL;DR: Grandma yearns to Just-No but chooses not to. Llamas rejoice!","92":"When I was 10 years old, it was a June 4th and I got a cast with the actual plaster because I fractured my pinky. Reason why? I had my hand opened when I blocked for a kick in Taekwondo sparring. I had to stop Taekwondo for some time. Anyways, let's get on to the story\n\nEM, EK (Entitled Kid), Me, SG (Security Guard), Mom\n\nSo me and mom were at West Ed Mall and I was getting my food at the food court. After I got my food, me and my mom sat down at a table. I told my mom I was going to go to the washroom so yeah, I did it.\n\nI was going into the Men's Washroom and after I pissed, I went to wash my hand and then here we go, our EK who is about 6-8:\n\nEK: Can I have your armour\n\nMe: *just realizing* No sorry this isn't armour, this is a cast because I fractured my pinky\n\nEK: Whyyyyyyyyyyyy, this is armour, I can tell cause it's hard\n\nMe: Sorry I really need it for pinky to heal\n\nEK: Awwwwwwww *gets pissed and walks away*\n\nAs soon as I got out of here, our star member come so out\n\nEK: That's him Mommy! *points to me*\n\nEM: *walks over to me* Excuse me, my son says you won't give your armour to him! Just give my angel your armour \n\nMe: No lady, this is a cast, I need it because I fractured my pinky and, it won't heal if I don't have a cast\n\nEM: CMON! My son has been getting so much grades, and you don't need that anyways! Your probably saving your own life instead of my poor angel's\n\nMe: No lady. Besides your son doesn't really need this, and again, this isn't armour\n\nEM: CMON GIVE IT HERE, IT'S PROBABLY JUST A BRUISE OR SOMETHING, AND I CAN TELL IT'S ARMOUR IT'S HARD. SO GIVE IT HERE \n\nShe actually tries to pull my cast out, but right on she can't since it is really wrapped around hard on my arm\n\nMe: ARE YOU THAT STUPID!?\n\nEM: HOW? YOU PROBABLY GLUED IT TO YOUR ARM SO MY ANGEL WON'T GET IT\n\nI pull my cast away and start walking back to my table while EM is REEEEEEEEEing out to me ranting about how I don't need that \"armour\"\n\n20 minutes into eating and I'm almost done my food, until I saw EM with the SG. SG approaches my table:\n\nEM: HA! YOU CAN'T ESCAPE NOW *to SG* Sir, this is the boy that stole my son's armour.\n\nSG: *looks at my cast and starts laughing* Ma'am that's a cast! Are you out of your mind?\n\nEM: B- B- BUT THIS IS ARMOUR, IT'S HARD AND IT HEALS THIS KID'S PINKY\n\nSG: Ma'am, this is a cast, it is used to heal a fractured, dislocated, or fully broken bone. And plus, this kid is way to young to be arrested\n\nEK: MOMMY MY ARMOUR \n\nEM: Don't worry sweetie, this evil cop and kid are trying to steal the armour\n\nAt this time my mom comes back\n\nMom: What the heck is going on?\n\nSG: Oh don't worry this mom and kid thinks your son's cast is armour\n\nEM: YOUR HIS MOM? GOOD YOUR SON HASN'T GIVE IN HIS ARMOUR BECAUSE HE THINKS MY ANGEL IS DISCRIMINATING\n\nMom: *she started laughing* THIS IS THE MOST IDIOTIC MOM I'VE EVER HEARD OF\n\nEM: HOW DARE YOU, IM NOT IDIOTIC, THAT IS ARMOUR YOUR SON IS USING I KNOW\n\nMom: *searches cast up and shows it to the EM: Lady read it\n\nEM: NO, I KNOW THE INTERNET IS LYING *she actually calls 911*\n\nSome time later, there is some paramedics. P if for The Paramedic that pretty much talked\n\nP: What's going on?\n\nEM: TELL THIS SG AND MOM THAT HE HAS ARMOUR\n\nP:  *looks at my cast* Ma'am, this is a cast, where do you get this information?\n\nEK: Oh I got it from minecraft\n\nEM goes pale white and grabs her kid as she runs away\n\nThe Paramedics head back to the hospital as EM wasted their time\n\nTL;DR: EK mistaken my cast as armour, gets his EM, and she tries to take my cast, A Security Guard comes and defends me instead, EM calls 911 and wastes their time\n\nMoral: Don't take MC too seriously\n\nEdit: Edited some 911 logic","93":"If you've been following the story so far, I'm sure it doesn't come as much surprise that SO and I did eventually procreate. When we found out that I was pregnant with baby number one, I was so excited. Not even Tweedle could wreck that for me. Oddly enough, I quickly became her favorite person. First grandbaby. So even though I didn't like her, she suddenly wanted to be best friends. Wanted to take me to all the appointments, babysit constantly, hinted to SO how she wanted to be in the delivery room, etc. All of these because \"Well, your mom lives out of state and you'll want someone with you for all of this!\" Yeah. I will. What the hell do you think your son is going to be doing??\n\nShe wanted to be the first to know about everything. Due date. Gender. The name we picked. It was irritating.\n\nNeedless to say, BIL and SIL always knew first, as we lived with them. SIL was crying next to me at the first ultrasound. My mom was the immediate second priority. I would call her and then we would call FIL, who would then tell Tweedle. \n\nFIL and I had a loooong talk about boundaries before I told him that I was not comfortable letting them babysit until she was a little older, a few months at least. He agreed. I also told him that I didn't want the baby at their house alone with Tweedle. He told me that whatever I wanted was fine with him, but that maybe it was best that we didn't word it that way when we told her and that he and I could just work that out when we came to that point. Seemed easier than a fight. I also asked him if he remembered the spanking conversation. He apologized and said that it was really insensitivite. He would freak if someone hit his kids, and he would never lay a hand to mine. I trust this man and his word explicitly, but just for good measure, I told him that if it became an issue, I would put my hands on him if he ever laid one on my kids. I also told him that it would be the last time they saw or heard from us. He promised it would never be an issue. \n\nDue date is set for March 2nd, 2016. I keep joking that since it's a leap year I hope the baby is born on February 29th. \n\nSO: Why?\n\nMe: Because then when they're asking me for a car for their 16th birthday, I can be like, \"A car? You're only four!!\"\n\n(SO, FIL, BIL, and SIL all laugh)\n\nTD: Well, I think thats just mean.\n\nMe: It was pretty obviously a joke. Sorry you didn't get it, the rest of us had a good laugh. \n\nCue CBF from Tweedle.\n\nSO and I find out we're having a girl. Tweedle freaks out because she has 4 boys and \"can't wait to dress up her granddaughter\"! I told her if the clothes she buys the baby are anything like the obnoxiously sparkly hoodie she bought our dog that she will lose that privilege reaaaal quick. FIL cracks up. Cue CBF.\n\nWe pick the name, which for obvious reasons, I will omit. Suffice to say that she shares her first name with a leading lady in a very well-known play. WE DID NOT NAME HER AFTER THAT CHARACTER. So because Tweedle is by law required to annoy me, every time she tells someone the name, its \"like from the play!\" And then I correct her. It's not like the play. Its not even spelled the same. \n\nIt only got more fun the closer we got to her due date.\n\nTL;DR Tweedle finds out I'm pregnant, suddenly thinks we are best friends. Is corrected abruptly.","94":"So my brother and some friends and I decided to buy a microwave and some random shit from goodwill to microwave at our house one summer. We got a bunch of silverware, a doll head, a golf ball and a can of aerosol hair dye. We start out in the front yard with the silverware and it just sparked a bit, but nothing big. We then do the baby doll and it starts smoking so my friend grabs his emergency gas mask out of his car (yeah idk why he had that) and we play around with this half melted baby doll head for like 10 minutes. Then we go to microwave the hair dye. We put it in there for 10 minutes, and absolutely nothing happened. We then decided to put it in there for 30 minutes and then go inside and play mario kart. After 10 minutes our friend goes outside, with his gas mask on, and puts his head right next to the microwave to check out the hair dye, and nothing happened. 10 more minutes goes by, and I swear to god it felt like an earthquake just happened. The windows shook, our ears rang and smoke was billowing out of the microwave in our front yard.  The front porch was covered in black hair dye, the glass plate had shattered and shot across the yard, the front door and the hair spray\/dye bottle was across the street 40 feet away, and the microwave had been shot back 5 feet from its' original resting place. A couple days later we were telling the story and our neighbor from down the street heard it while she was working with her headphones in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: bought a microwave, put a can of hairspray in it, accidentally made a bomb","95":"So there's me [29F], my best friend [29F], and her fiance [30sM]. They just got engaged last week. I'm going to be her maid of honor. Yay!\n\nHer fiance is fine. We're not BFFs or anything, but he's cool. He's kind of a socially awkward nerd, and it's hard to get him to open up without bringing up what he's most interested in (what he does for a living, whatever TV show he's watching) and then the conversation with him can get a little one-sided.\n\nMy best friend and I have been friends since we were 15. Five-ish years ago (before my best friend started dating her fiance), she and I watched The Wire together. We both now consider it our favorite show.\n\nAnyway, after watching that show, I started calling her, 'D' as a nickname, because, well, her name starts with D, and also, there's a character we both liked who was also called 'D.' I almost exclusively call her by her nickname now. \n   \n(WARNING. There's a spoiler for the Wire in the following paragraph, so if you haven't seen it yet, don't keep reading!)\n\nI got this very unexpected message from her fiance last night on Facebook. He told me that now that he and D are getting married, he kindly requests that I stop calling her by the nickname I gave her, as it's \"not a very mature way of addressing her. I would hate to think you calling her that during your speech at our wedding.\" He also went on to say that he never approved of that nickname anyway, because the character gets murdered in the show and he \"doesn't like that imagery associated with my future wife.\"\n\nI'm not the most diplomatic person, so I don't entirely know to respond. I'm not even entirely sure if I should say anything at all. There's, hahaha, also part of me that wants to send back, \"Sure, no problem, bro. I'll just start calling her Bodie instead. Or maybe Omar. Oh, I know, I'll start calling her Snoop! Snoop would be a *great* fit for her!\" A similar part of me wants to agree with him, and then during their wedding, just use her nickname constantly during my speech. And there's another (admittedly, angrier) part of me that wants to say, \"What? Are you kidding me? No. Request denied. Oh, and fuck you. Don't ever dictate to me how I should interact with my best friend.\" \n\nThere's also this weird...possessiveness associated with his wording the message. He never calls her by her name, just a lot of \"*my* future wife\" and \"*my* fiance.\" My best friend is fiercely independent, and I know she wouldn't appreciate being talked about like that. So maybe I should forward the message on to her saying something like, \"Hey...your fiance just sent this to me and I don't really know what to make of it.\"\n\nEDIT FOR AN IMPORTANT DETAIL THAT I FORGOT TO ADD: My best friend and I are both bisexual, and we have made out in the past. Just made out. A good handful of times in high school (we were like, \"We need to practice for our future boyfriends!\" but now that we're older, we laugh about all that now and are like, \"Right. Yeah. 'Boyfriends.' Sure. Uh huh.\") and, I dunno, four or five times in college (while drunk at parties). \n\nWe had talked about dating each other, but, I dunno...we love each other, but I don't think we would ever be *in love* with each other. We're pretty different people, which is why I think we make such good friends, but not terribly good significant others. The last time we talked about being in a relationship was, like, I dunno, 8 years ago?\n\nIt's now only just occurring to me that maybe this has something to do with her fiance's unexpected message...\n\nAny advice would be appreciative. Thanks, y'all.\n\n**tl;dr**: My best friend's fiance has asked me to stop calling her a nickname I gave her before the two of them even started dating. I don't know how to kindly tell him to shove it.\n\nUPDATE: Well! I just got off the phone with D. She called me, I started to answer like I usually do, (\"'Sup, D?\") But then, remembering that maybe she doesn't want to be called that anymore, I just sort of awkwardly extended the 'D' sound into her full name (so I answered like, \"'Sup Deeeeeeeee[full name]?\")\n\nShe immediately said, \"[Fiance] told you to stop calling me D, didn't he?\"\n\nI said yes, and she exclaimed, \"What the fuck, I can't believe he actually fucking did that! Look, I gotta go, I'll talk to you later. And *don't* stop calling me D.\"\n\n\"You got it, D.\"\n\nWe said our goodbyes and she hung up. Soooooooo...I think *someone* mighta crossed a line...\n\nUPDATE 2: I just tried to post an update, but it was immediately deleted because this post is still on the front page. Long story short, D's fiance crossed a line, they got into the most ridiculous fight, and she is at my place right now. Not entirely sure when (or if) she's going to go back home. I'll post a proper update as soon as this one is no longer on the front page.","96":"One rainy Sunday morning, I woke up with a craving for some filling, delicious pancakes. I was hungover and really out of it, but pancake mix is easy enough, so in 10 minutes I had a pan full of hot, tasty pancakes. As I grabbed a plate and brought it near the pan to transfer the pancakes, I got too excited and banged it against the hot pan - and the plate instantly shattered in my hands. Next thing I know, my pancakes and the ground are covered in shards of plate, and my foot has a 2-inch slice through the ankle, pouring blood.\n\nI didn't even feel any pain, I was so surprised and hungover. I just though, \"Well fuck. There go my pancakes\". I tried to put pressure on my foot to stop the bleeding, but it soaked through everything and I realized that the situation might be serious. I drove myself to the nearest ER. After a 3-hour wait, I was finally seen by some frazzled doc. He didn't really bother to check out the injury - just did a quick x-ray to make sure there was no glass stuck inside, stitched me up, and sent me home.\n\n2 weeks later, the stitches came out and I had a gnarly scar. But there was a bigger problem: after trying to walk normally for the first time, I realized that I couldn't lift my foot properly. Every time I tried to take a step, I stumbled and stubbed my toes on the ground. \n\nThis was alarming, so I called around and got the first available appointment with an orthopedic surgeon - which was over a month after the initial injury. When he saw my foot, he gave me a look that said \"You fucked up bad\". As it turned out after a bunch of tests, the broken plate had somehow stabbed my foot in a precise way to sever one of the most important tendons of the ankle.... the tendon that helps lift the foot during walking. The surgeon was flabbergasted and said the odds of that happening from a broken plate were 1 in a million. The tendon was supposed to be thick and incredibly strong, but I guess I beat the odds! \n\nThe worst part was that according to the surgeon, if the severed tendon had been found right after the injury, he could have easily just stitched it back together. But because I wasn't diagnosed right away and time had passed, the tendon ends had retracted far from each other. And severed tendons never heal. To fix it, I need to have a large and invasive surgery, with a cadaver transplant tendon, pins, screws, metal plates, and many months of pain and recovery.  The cost of the surgery at this point is more than I can afford even after insurance covers its part, so I guess I am living with a defective foot. \n\nTL;DR: Tried to make pancakes, broke a plate, got misdiagnosed at the ER, and ended up permanently crippling my foot. ","97":"I'll try to be short. \ntl;dr DH finds out his dad is not his dad, wants me to talk to MIL\n\nBasically through the magic of DNA we found out the man supposed to be my DH's bio father, is not. Her first husband always swore my husband was a \"Smith\" and he was adopted by her second husband almost 40 years ago. \n\nWhen he first took the test I asked if there was any reason he shouldn't. She was evasive. When he matched distantly with a relative of the suspected \"Smith\" I asked again. No information\n\nNow he's matched with not one, but two of the \"Smith\" sisters as probable aunts. This means one of their brothers is his dad. No big deal huh? Just confirmed what was suspected. \n\nBut no, DH is pretty pissed. Not only does he feel she lied, but we are fairly close to the \"Smith\" family and apparently they all found out a few weeks before him. So now a few have been calling him cuz for a bit. He feels like everyone knew but him. He even argued with one guy that nope  he wasn't really related. \n\nSo now he expects me to talk to his mom and find out who the suspect is. I do not want to do this. I do not know what to say. How can I bring this up to her? She obviously doesn't want to talk about it.  And she's notorious for belittling other people's emotions. In her mind she got him a new better father and this is not important. How can I make her see that it's important to him. We're pretty LC due to many reasons. So her and I aren't close. Two of her four kids are totally NC already, I'd hate to make it 3.","98":"I have posted a couple times. This ones long sorry. TLDR is the title pretty much. \n\nWhen I was a teenager my jnmoms favorite punishment was to take the door off of my bedroom and bathroom. Didnt do the dishes? Say goodbye to the doors. Didnt clean her and my jnstepdads bedroom and bathroom? Goodbye doors. Wanted to hangout with friends after school? Goodbye doors for even asking. \n\nNaturally I threw fits about this. I'm a teenager and I need privacy. How can you make a teenage girl use the bathroom and shower without a door? Jnmoms logic was it didnt matter, teenagers have no right to privacy. \n\nAfter throwing fits about having no doors to change behind or do necissary bathroom tasks, I got timed showers added to the no doors punishment. 10 minutes max. If you went over the 10 minutes jnmom, or sometimes jnstepdad on jnmoms command, would come in and shut the shower off. Didnt matter if there was soap in your hair or you were in the middle of something. 10 minutes is 10 minutes. \n\nThen, my aunt got me this really expensive shampoo and hair mask to use. She made sure I new how to use them and wanted me to let her know how they were working for my hair. I had greasy hair with a dry scalp and she wanted to help me. Well, you see, the hair mask need more than 10 minutes to just be in the hair. So, I can use it with only being allowed 10 minute showers.\n\nThe next time we saw my aunt she asked how the shampoo and mask was working and if I wanted her to get me more. I then had the opportunity to have a little fun with the no doors punishment, in front of a house full of family members. I simply told her the shampoo was nice, but I hadn't been able to use the mask because I'm not allowed to take a shower for more than 10 minutes or jnmom would come in and shut the water off. \n\nI then had to explain more on that if I went over 10 minutes jnmom came in and shut the water off while I was showering. I also said I couldnt lock them out to prevent this because they took the doors off my bedroom and bathroom. Let me tell you, the room got so quiet after I said this. Everyone looked at me with confused expressions. \n\nI got a few \"oh, they are installing new doors so you dont have one for a little while?\" type of questions. While jnmom is staring daggers at me. I then had an opportunity to explaine to the whole room that, \"No, I had to stay late at work because we were busy. So I got home later than I normally would. Jnmom took the doors away because I was home later than normal.\" (I worked in food service, it sometimes happened)\n\nMy aunt then asked jnmom to explain what in the hell I was talking about. Jnmoms response \"Purpleplatypuss doesnt know what she's talking about. I'm allowed to punish my kids how I want\". Sound logic right? Needless to say jnmom got chewed out from all directions. There were threats that cps would be called if the doors weren't replaced and I wasnt allowed privacy. It was made clear to jnmom that if the doors were removed one more time there would be major problems. Family threatened to stop by randomly to make sure the doors stayed up.\n\nJnmom was pissed. I just made her look bad to her entire family. I knew there would be hell to pay, but my teenage self gave no fucks at that point.","99":" \nA long time ago when I was in middle school, My friend Steve (not his real name) and I would hang out at his house right after school. What was great about going over his house was that his parents didn\u2019t come home until later in the evening, so we basically did whatever we wanted. \n \nThis was a time before next-gen Xbox\u2019s, PS3\u2019s and shit, so we\u2019d usually play super smash on the gamecube, ride bikes outside, smoke some of his dad\u2019s cigars, crank call people, and other typical juvenile shit. One thing we use to do a lot was play this trap game where one of us would wait in a room for 5 minutes while the other set booby traps in the basement. After the 5 minutes were up, the person who waited comes out wearing a blindfold and has to walk to the other side of the room without falling victim to whatever trap the other person setup. The more intricate the traps, the more fun it was. There were times when we had 5-10 people over and played all day. Those of you that have done similar know how fun this kind of game is\/was, especially when you got someone good.\n \nSo after playing some smash, we decide to fuck around with the trap game. Per usual, I would be blindfolded first since it was Steve's house. I went in the room, tied the rag around my eyes and waited. After like 10 minutes, which was uncommonly long, Steve gave me the go ahead to come out. I felt for the door knob, opened the door and walked straight. Like anyone who\u2019s blindfolded and wary of the unexpected, I wailed my arms around and took awkward strides\u2026.until I stepped on something and heard a **CRUNCH**...followed by laughter. I ripped my blindfold off to see that I stepped on a red solo cup filled with a yellow liquid that soaked my sock.  \n \nSteve had filled up a few cups with his piss and scattered them on the floor as traps for me to step on. He thought it was hilarious, I thought it was a shitty trap and dick move (honestly, who would do that in their own house???). It was all the more reason to get him back with a trap he\u2019d never see coming ;). \n \nAs he waited in the room, I grabbed the power adaptor to the gamecube (you know, the one that has the bulky box thing) and leveled\/tied the cord to one of the blades on his ceiling fan. His fan spun incredibly fast and it wasn\u2019t too far off the ground either which made this the perfect trap he\u2019d never expect. After I fastened the wire, I turned the fan on high speed and watched as the power adaptor block swung around like a bastard. I called for Steve to come out and he emerged. \n \nSteve began to walk around the outside of the room, then back towards the middle and back again. The fan is kind of in the center so I was banking on him walking straight. After a minute of him being a pussy, he finally headed to the fan and then **BANG!**\n \nThe power adaptor nailed him perfectly on the side of the head and he fell down immediately. I laughed uncontrollably until I realized he wasn\u2019t moving. I shouted his name a few times, no response. I shook his body, no response. \n \nAfter a minute or two, I convinced myself that I killed my friend. Being terrified, I ran home without calling anyone and hid in my room all night.\n \nThe next morning, I was expecting to see the news report of a kid who died from massive head trauma caused by a swinging power adaptor. To my relief, I saw Steve in school with a bandage on his head. Apparently, he was just knocked out and woke up soon after I fled home. He wasn\u2019t too happy with me, neither were his parents when they came home and found out what happened.\n \nIt took a while for Steve to forgive me, especially for running home like a pussy instead of trying to help.\n \n**TL;DR: Played a blindfolded trap game with my friend. He set up cups filled with piss that I stepped on. I got him back by tying a power adaptor block to a spinning ceiling fan. The block nails him in the head and I run home thinking I killed him. Him and his parents were not too happy.**\n \n \n"},"prompt":{"0":"Based on the information provided in the document, what are the key factors contributing to the author's consideration of taking a
