[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9kw8w3/my\_40s\_boyfriend\_40s\_has\_started\_getting\_stoned/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9kw8w3/my_40s_boyfriend_40s_has_started_getting_stoned/)

Quick summary: Boyfriend has gone from smoking weed a couple of times per week to smoking three or four sessions every night. He is stoned from the time he sits down to dinner until he falls asleep. I have nothing against weed, but there are work issues for me. Don't care if he smokes sometimes, but now it is EVERY time we are together and we can't even have a normal conversation. Recently, he's started complaining that sex is no good because we aren't "in sync".

&amp;#x200B;

After last post, I discussed the weed and sex issue with BF. I told him that I feel like the one of the reasons we are not in sync sometimes is because he is stoned every time and way far off in his own little world. I sometimes feel he's more trying to act out a porn movie with a stranger instead of being engaged with me, and that he becomes too rough and impersonal. He seemed surprised that I had those concerns and said he'd not smoke up so that we could be in the same state of mind. Later, sex ensues. Immediately afterward - like 2 minutes - he had to "go to the bathroom". Of course, he came back reeking of weed. I get that he might have wanted to get high to go to sleep; however, I can't help but feel irritated that he got up and left the room immediately after he got what he wanted and got high again. And, although he doesn't need to ask my permission, it would have been nice if he had asked if I minded considering we had a lengthy conversation about it before going to bed. I went to sleep feeling used and second place to weed.

I'm thinking of asking him for a break until my work matters get settled and we can agree on what amount of smoking is ok when we are together.  I'm hoping that we can start spending some time together with him sober again becasue it has been really sad to see him go from who he was to a stoned zombie every night. If you substitute any other substance into the context of this situation (alcohol, prescription meds, etc.) this would be labeled addiction. I realize that weed doesn't hold that stigma, yet I am sitting on the sofa every evening watching Cartoon Network with no hope of intelligent conversation.  I'm losing respect for him.

Anyone have any experience with this? Can come to an agreement, or it is better to start looking for an exit from this relationship? I am fully willing to compromise, but he seems unable to put it aside for even one night.  Even if my situation allows me to participate again, I know I don't want it in my life on an everyday basis.

Other info:

1. We only spend 50% of our time together, so he also has  plenty of time to do this when I'm not around.  I don't understand why he has to be stoned the entire time that we are together.
2. I am fairly positive that he was not hiding excessive use from me when we first met and that this habit has evolved from casual use a couple times a week to 3 or 4 times per night over the past six months. He is much different when he's stoned and not good at hiding it.
3. The ease and convenience of using a vape pen with high THC may be contributing to the problem. He has no interest in switching products or methods - we have discussed this.

## bm_ca_0

I discussed the weed and sex issue with my boyfriend, expressing my feelings about how his constant state of being stoned affects our intimacy and synchronization during sex. I explained that it sometimes feels like he's more engaged with acting out a scenario rather than being present with me, and that his behavior becomes too rough and impersonal. He seemed surprised by my concerns and promised not to smoke so that we could be on the same mental state. However, he ended up smoking again shortly after our conversation.

## bm_ca_1

The specific effects on the relationship attributed to my boyfriend's marijuana use include his inability to engage in normal conversation due to being stoned every time we are together, which has led to a lack of intellectual engagement and feeling like I'm watching a stoned zombie every night. Additionally, his marijuana use has affected our sexual relationship; I feel he becomes too rough and impersonal, trying to act out a porn movie rather than being engaged with me. This has contributed to a feeling of being used and placed second to his desire to get high, especially noticeable when he immediately smoked after sex despite our prior discussion about his usage.

## bm_ca_2

I discussed the weed and sex issue with my boyfriend, expressing my concerns about how his constant state of being stoned affects our intimacy and our ability to connect. I suggested that he not smoke up so that we could be in the same state of mind, especially during intimate moments. Additionally, we talked about possibly switching products or methods of consuming marijuana, though he showed no interest in making such changes.

I explained that it feels like he's more focused on acting out a scene than being present with me, which sometimes makes the sex feel rough and impersonal. He seemed surprised by my concerns and promised not to smoke so that we could be on the same level mentally. However, immediately after we had sex, he went to 'go to the bathroom' and returned smelling of weed, which made me feel used and secondary to his desire to get high.

The proposed solution if the issue persists includes:

1. **Requesting a Break**: The person is considering asking for a break from the relationship until their work matters are settled and they can agree on a reasonable amount of smoking when together. This break is seen as a potential way to reassess the relationship dynamics and the boyfriend’s willingness to compromise on his marijuana use.

2. **Reevaluation of the Relationship**: Implicit in their actions and considerations is the potential reevaluation of the relationship’s viability if the boyfriend continues to prioritize marijuana use over the relationship’s needs.
