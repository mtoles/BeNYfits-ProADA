[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9kw8w3/my\_40s\_boyfriend\_40s\_has\_started\_getting\_stoned/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9kw8w3/my_40s_boyfriend_40s_has_started_getting_stoned/)

Quick summary: Boyfriend has gone from smoking weed a couple of times per week to smoking three or four sessions every night. He is stoned from the time he sits down to dinner until he falls asleep. I have nothing against weed, but there are work issues for me. Don't care if he smokes sometimes, but now it is EVERY time we are together and we can't even have a normal conversation. Recently, he's started complaining that sex is no good because we aren't "in sync".

&amp;#x200B;

After last post, I discussed the weed and sex issue with BF. I told him that I feel like the one of the reasons we are not in sync sometimes is because he is stoned every time and way far off in his own little world. I sometimes feel he's more trying to act out a porn movie with a stranger instead of being engaged with me, and that he becomes too rough and impersonal. He seemed surprised that I had those concerns and said he'd not smoke up so that we could be in the same state of mind. Later, sex ensues. Immediately afterward - like 2 minutes - he had to "go to the bathroom". Of course, he came back reeking of weed. I get that he might have wanted to get high to go to sleep; however, I can't help but feel irritated that he got up and left the room immediately after he got what he wanted and got high again. And, although he doesn't need to ask my permission, it would have been nice if he had asked if I minded considering we had a lengthy conversation about it before going to bed. I went to sleep feeling used and second place to weed.

I'm thinking of asking him for a break until my work matters get settled and we can agree on what amount of smoking is ok when we are together.  I'm hoping that we can start spending some time together with him sober again becasue it has been really sad to see him go from who he was to a stoned zombie every night. If you substitute any other substance into the context of this situation (alcohol, prescription meds, etc.) this would be labeled addiction. I realize that weed doesn't hold that stigma, yet I am sitting on the sofa every evening watching Cartoon Network with no hope of intelligent conversation.  I'm losing respect for him.

Anyone have any experience with this? Can come to an agreement, or it is better to start looking for an exit from this relationship? I am fully willing to compromise, but he seems unable to put it aside for even one night.  Even if my situation allows me to participate again, I know I don't want it in my life on an everyday basis.

Other info:

1. We only spend 50% of our time together, so he also has  plenty of time to do this when I'm not around.  I don't understand why he has to be stoned the entire time that we are together.
2. I am fairly positive that he was not hiding excessive use from me when we first met and that this habit has evolved from casual use a couple times a week to 3 or 4 times per night over the past six months. He is much different when he's stoned and not good at hiding it.
3. The ease and convenience of using a vape pen with high THC may be contributing to the problem. He has no interest in switching products or methods - we have discussed this.

I discussed the weed and sex issue with my boyfriend, expressing my feelings that his constant state of being stoned affects our intimacy and synchronization during sex. I mentioned that it feels like he's more trying to act out a porn movie with a stranger rather than being engaged with me, and that he becomes too rough and impersonal when he's stoned.

## bm_ca_1

The specific impacts on the relationship due to my boyfriend's marijuana use include a lack of normal conversation as he is stoned from dinner until he falls asleep, issues with sexual intimacy where he becomes too rough and impersonal, and a general feeling of being second place to his weed consumption. Additionally, there's a loss of respect for him as he has transformed from who he was to what I described as a 'stoned zombie' every night.

## full_pm_output

The person has taken several steps to communicate their concerns about their boyfriend's increasing marijuana use and its impact on their relationship:

1. **Direct Communication**: They have directly discussed the issue of marijuana use and its effect on their sexual relationship with their boyfriend. They expressed their feelings about feeling out of sync during intimate moments due to his constant state of being stoned.

2. **Expressing Personal Feelings**: They shared their personal feelings of being used and neglected, especially after the boyfriend immediately smoked weed after being intimate, despite having just discussed the issue.

3. **Setting Expectations**: They communicated their expectations for shared time together, emphasizing the desire for more sober interactions to facilitate meaningful conversations and a healthier relationship dynamic.

The proposed solution if the issue persists includes:

1. **Requesting a Break**: The person is considering asking for a break from the relationship until their work matters are settled and they can agree on a reasonable amount of smoking when together. This break is seen as a potential way to reassess the relationship dynamics and the boyfriend’s willingness to compromise on his marijuana use.

2. **Reevaluation of the Relationship**: Implicit in their actions and considerations is the potential reevaluation of the relationship’s viability if the boyfriend continues to prioritize marijuana use over the relationship’s needs. They are contemplating whether it might be better to look for an exit from the relationship if a compromise cannot be reached.

Overall, the person is seeking a balance where they can coexist with their boyfriend’s marijuana use without it overshadowing their relationship and personal needs. They are willing to compromise but also prepared to make tough decisions if their needs continue to be unmet.

## summ_pm_output

The document does not provide specific details about the steps the person has taken to communicate their concerns regarding their boyfriend's increasing marijuana use. It also does not explicitly mention any proposed solutions if the issue persists, other than the person considering asking for a break from the relationship due to losing respect.

## ca_0_pm_output

The person has taken the following steps to communicate their concerns about their boyfriend's marijuana use and its impact on their relationship:

1. **Discussion**: The person has directly discussed the issue with their boyfriend, specifically addressing how his constant state of being stoned affects their intimacy and synchronization during sex.

2. **Expressing Feelings**: They have expressed their feelings clearly, stating that the marijuana use makes the boyfriend act in a way that feels impersonal and rough, akin to acting out a porn movie rather than engaging intimately with them.

The proposed solution if the issue persists, as indicated in the document, is that the person is considering asking for a break from the relationship. This suggests that they are contemplating taking a step back from the relationship if their concerns are not addressed or if the situation does not improve.

## ca_1_pm_output

Based on the document provided, there is no explicit mention of the steps the person has taken to communicate their concerns about their boyfriend's marijuana use and its impact on their relationship. The document does not detail any conversations or actions taken to address the issue directly with the boyfriend. 

The proposed solution, as indicated in the document, is that the person is considering asking for a break from the relationship due to the loss of respect stemming from the boyfriend's behavior and the negative impacts of his marijuana use.

## ca_2_pm_output

Based on the document provided, the person has not explicitly mentioned any steps they have already taken to communicate their concerns about their boyfriend's increasing marijuana use and its impact on their relationship. However, the document does indicate that the person is considering asking for a break from the relationship. This suggests that they are contemplating addressing the issue directly by proposing a temporary separation. The proposed solution if the issue persists is to take a break until their work matters are settled and they can agree on an acceptable amount of smoking when they are together. This indicates a desire to set boundaries and find a compromise regarding the boyfriend's marijuana use in the context of their relationship.

## ca_ex_pm_output

The person has taken the following steps to communicate their concerns about their boyfriend's marijuana use and its impact on their relationship:

1. **Direct Communication**: The person directly discussed the issue with their boyfriend, explicitly stating how his behavior while under the influence of marijuana affects their relationship negatively. They mentioned feeling out of sync with him because he is often stoned, which makes him seem distant and disconnected.

2. **Specific Examples**: They provided specific examples of how his behavior changes when he is stoned, such as trying to act out a porn movie and becoming too rough and impersonal during intimate moments.

3. **Expressing Feelings**: They communicated how these actions make them feel, emphasizing the lack of engagement and the impersonal nature of their interactions when he is under the influence.

The proposed solution if the issue persists, as inferred from the document, is:
- **Change in Behavior**: The boyfriend agreed to not smoke marijuana so that they could be in the same state of mind and more in sync. This suggests that the person is giving their boyfriend an opportunity to change his behavior to see if it positively affects their relationship dynamics.

If this solution does not lead to a satisfactory change, it is implied (though not explicitly stated in the document) that the person might consider taking a break from the relationship, as indicated by their initial thought of "thinking of asking for a break from the relationship because losing respect." This indicates that continuing issues might lead to more drastic measures to preserve their well-being and respect in the relationship.
