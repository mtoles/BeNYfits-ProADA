AIATAH,"My wife and I had difficulties in conceiving due to an accident I had when I as younger. After three years we finally had our daughter three weeks ago. Baby and mum are home and healthy, but I have been on the couch due to an issue over the surname.
My wife was previously in a longterm relationship with her ex who commited suicide due to mental health issues after he returned from service abroad. Her son from her first relationship lives with us and is twelve in a months time. Her son has her exes surname. She wants our baby to have her exes surname (she still goes by that name) so that her son doesn't feel left out from his new sibling and future siblings, and because he had a better name than mine. I tried to compromise by saying since I practically raised her son he can have my surname, that way he won't feel left out, and she can take my name too. She said no as he has had his name all his life and shouldn't have to change it to appease me.
I tried to explain that they have two seperate fathers so it's natural that they have different names. I suggested she use her maiden surname and hyphenate it with mine for our baby and she can hyphenate her maiden name with her exes for her son, that way the siblings will have almost the same name. That was turned down too.
We have to register the baby's name next Thursday. I told her that we should probably gets couples therapy and in the meantime register her with my name. She turned that down too and said she went throught the trouble of carrying her and pushing her out, and she should get to decide this on her own.
I even asked her son and he said he doesn't mind having separate names as he knows his father was his father but I am dad. He doesn't care if his sister has a different surname. I told my wife this and she said I am emotionally manipulating her son.
We had an argument five days ago and haven't spoken much. I didn't want it to continue like this as this should be our happy moments. Two days ago I told her that the baby either gets my surname or we are getting a divorce. I told her that perhaps her dead husband could help raise our daughter with her since she doesn't want to acknowledge me as the dad. She called me a manipulator and says it's not fair that she doesn't get to decide the baby's first name on her own or the surname (her suggestions for the first name when she was pregnant were feminine versions of her exes name, think Alexis, Alexia, Alexandra for Alexander, and his actual name if we had had a boy).
Today I called a solicitor and she overheard. She is telling me that I am forcing her into a corner with this name thing even though we went with her choice of first name after I sifted out the ones similar to her exes. and my choice as a middle name.
I just want some outside opinions on whether I am doing the right thing. Like what am I doing with life anymore. It's so messed up."
AITA,"Hi y‘all! This sub recently helped me out with another issue so I figured I could return and present another issue, even though it‘s not that dramatic.
Context: My family was at a restaurant to eat out because we celebrated Uncle‘s 50th Birthday. We also brought our dog along. I completely understand when people are annoyed when there are dogs everywhere and some people really take it too far, I get it, but basically we had no choice. Our girl has trauma and can‘t stay alone for too long and we had no one to watch her. And, I know everyone says that, but she‘s really well behaved. She just lays under the table, looks around a bit and sometimes begs a little, but only from us. She‘s also really small.
Anyway, there were some couples and groups of threes present but the only other bigger party were, what I guess, a mum, a grandma and two kids (3-6ish). I should say that I like kids. I really do. I want to work with kids in fact (I‘m 18, btw). But these little guys were still somewhat disturbing. They screeched and yelled and one of the kids asked like three times for fries when they were already ordered for him. A bit annoying but not to the point I would complain, honestly.
However, pretty suddenly the grandma started to complain about people that bring their dog everywhere and that it‘s so gross when one is in a closed area. She looked in our direction with an annoyed face and I admit, it annoyed me pretty much. Would it have been any of the other guests, I would understand. But our girl was simply minding her own business while their kiddos annoyed everyone. So I looked at her and said „That‘s rich coming from you, since your group is the most disturbing one here while no one complains about Tinka“.
The grandma stared at me and then looked at my parents so they would say something but my mom simply continued to eat and my dad looked back at her and grinned. She looked like she wanted to say more but the other woman told her to let it be and tried to calm the kids down. We didn‘t interact further the rest of our stay.
This happend two days ago but I‘m still unsure if I was my call to say what I said. Because I know how kids can be and it really can be annoying when everyone brings their dog everywhere but I just felt the need to defend my dog because she wasn‘t doing anything."
entitled parents,"I'm a 14-year-old girl, and I've been going through a lot in my life, but today my anger is getting worse.My mother (50 years old, Woman) and my stepfather (47 years old, Man) have been complaining to me about everything. I have a twin sister, who she acts like a young Karen I would say.
She's the kind of person that if you complain about her in front of her she'll play the victim, and she also doesn't give anyone the slightest bit of privacy.I was quiet in my room talking to my half-brother, my sister comes in and I rudely weigh her out because it's not the first time she's done this and I was in a serious matter between me and my half-brother (we were venting to each other), suddenly I get a notification from my mom saying: ""Why can't your sister join the conversation? I tell her to be quiet. Stop excluding your sister.""
I took a deep breath and replied that the problem wasn't that she didn't talk, but that she listened, so my sister left the room after I insisted so much. It doesn't even pass 5 minutes she comes back to my room doing the same and complaining, only now she starts sending stupid things on my whatsapp and I ask her to stop but she doesn't stop. I get angry again and ask her to leave but she starts correcting my speech and doesn't leave, so I curse her and push her out of the room. Suddenly, I hear a small repeated knock on my door, (at this moment I need to let you know that I am autistic level 1 support, I have a high hearing sensitivity and sometimes some repetitive sounds bother me, such as knocks on the door, chalk on the board, noises of pens with brush tips passing on the paper, some more.).
I open the door it's my sister's mini Karen banging on wood who holds the door with a sad face. I get pissed off and go to my mom to complain. So it happens this:
Mother: ""I'm going to talk to your sister""
Me: ""ok""
Come into her room, me, my sister's Karen, my mother and my stepfather (I'll name him Ruy for how long).
Ruy: ""Every day I can't take it anymore, my mother is already in the hospital almost dying, I'm already tired, you don't have sympathy with us, don't you?""
Mom: ""Every weekend you guys fighting, we're in trouble enough y'all just getting worse""
Ruy: ""Next tantrum I'm going to sleep in the fucking hospital with my mom, because at least there I have peace, I haven't slept in 3 days""
They lecture upon sermon, especially on me. The conversation ends I go to my room and I just want to punch everything, my sister's face, or something else. Every day, they complain that I talk badly about my sister, and I don't trust them and I don't tell them anything, but because I would tell things to someone who ruined all my trust in her, thinks I don't deserve privacy, always complains about me when my sister does something wrong and I get the blame in the situation for complaining about her. They complain about my own sister to me all the time, but I can't complain about her? Then it gets difficult."
relationships,"I'm honestly kind of just looking for affirmation I've done everything I can here but if anyone has some kind of last hail Mary I'd be open to it.
The topic of marriage has been a major point of contention for the last four years. In the beginning of our relationship he on his own brought up how much he wanted to get married to me, how he can't wait to get married, ect ect which was exciting for me at first because I felt the same. Time goes on and there's no concrete plans being made. Not proud but I basically had a breakdown on our 5 year anniversary when he got me a Fitbit and he claimed he had no idea marriage was that important to me. He NEEDS a house before considering getting married. Ok.
I'm skipping over a bit but we go to counseling, things seem to be moving in a direction. He buys the house and takes me on a trip he planned that had all the markings of an engagement trip. No engagement. A few days later I breakdown again, the trip was incredibly cruel in my view. He's shocked, somehow, begs me not to leave. Four months later he proposes. As you can imagine I'm extremely cautious about this since I'm pretty sure it's just to get me to stay around.
I start planning, I try to include him, he says he'll reach out to places and he doesn't. I again say ok you've made it super clear you do not want this with your inaction, I'm calling it. We go to counseling AGAIN because I'm an idiot. He reveals some traumatic things he needs to work through and I say ok I'll give space for that. He goes to his own therapy and says he wants to get married before the end of the year. I wanted a little more time as it'd be incredibly stressful and rushed and I wanted to have fun planning with him, not make it more stressful than it's been. Again, I'm an idiot.
He will not plan anything. I've been giving him space to talk about things, we agreed he'd be more proactive in this and he straight up will not talk to me about anything on his own. I broke my own rule about not bringing it up again and I've tried sprinkling it into conversation here and there trying to be super casual and not pressured at all. He responds with completely passive language that effectively kills the conversation.
This morning I woke up unable to do it any more. I suggested we just go to town hall and he was like yea whatever is that what you want? I did the immature thing and kind of just left the room. No, obviously it isn't want I want. I want someone who is excited and can't wait to marry me, who keeps his promises. So why am I chasing this person who only makes an effort when I'm leaving?
He has depression and a really stressful job. Outside of this he's a really good partner but I feel like I can't be a forever girlfriend. Someone out there will be absolutely ecstatic to marry me, I know it. Is there any last come to Jesus moment I can have with this guy? I've written letters, I've cried, I've had conversation after conversation, we've been to counseling multiple times, I've given space for him to show he's all in. I feel like I've given my all here. Is there anything else I can do to save us?"
justnomil,"So my MIL crossed the coup de grace of all boundaries for me a long time ago. My husband is alright that I’m NC because I showed him everything they’d been saying and he realized how awful they treated me.
Long story short he’s LC because my BIL is really sweet. I like my BIL a lot. But my BIL is a package deal with my ILs which is why my husband is VLC.
For Christmas my husband wants to visit my BIL to show him our new baby. I’m fine with this. But I know I’ll be seeing my MIL.
Now the boundary she crossed for me was that when I lived with her postpartum the first time for some extra support while DH worked (big mistake) I told her I’m not speaking to any of my family as my own mother specifically bought me as a baby as a caretaker not to be her daughter and ruined my start to life. She threatened violence, calling the cops for no reason when she didn’t get her way and when I didn’t comply she’d tell literally everyone how awful I was. Ruined my reputation with people who’d known me my whole life if I didn’t give her my paycheck, which was meager, and kept me isolated. I said all of this to my MIL.
MIL heard me, I made it abundantly clear the relationship and how I was not going to see this person again. Me and DH went back to our home and lo and behold I get a letter from my “mother” trying to contact me. She got the address from MIL.
That was it, I was pissed. My MIL can’t even get away with saying that she didn’t know or how she wasn’t aware I wasn’t going to speak to this woman again.
So now I and DH are on the same page. No more pictures or updates of our children. MIL can do what she wants. Be in communication with whoever she wants, be friends with whoever she wants. But if she wants to be close to me this wasn’t it.
So when I go back down I plan to confront my MIL. I want to keep it clear and polite even though I’ve been given no such courtesy from my ILs. What’s best to say to her.
“MIL, I don’t mean to control who you speak to, that’s your business and not mine. But when you did this it crossed a major line for me. I feel as though it can’t be said you didn’t know my wishes, intentions, and boundaries when it came to my “mother”. Therefore, I don’t feel comfortable sharing pictures or updates in my children and their lives with you as you’d rather be proxy to give this information to someone who actively meant and means to harm me.”
If you need more context on the other stuff my MIL has done feel free to pities ky archive of her insanity."
askwomanadvice,"My (24f) partner (25m) of 3 years has a disabled brother (27m). He has autism, but is high functioning and able to work full time remotely from home. He has some health issues that aren’t major, but require meds and occasional visit to the hospital,However, their parents have always been protective so the he is unable to cook, refill medication or live by himself. When he’s asked to do something he doesn’t feel like, he throws a fit and the parents relent. He lives at home and doesn’t pay for anything, but spends all his money on games and other things. They have another brother who is much older. That brother holds a great deal of resentment towards his disabled brother and they have a strained relationship. If anything were to happen to their parent, the responsibility would fall on my bf.
He loves his brother and is willing to take care of him. I have a good relationship with his brother and admire his (bf) dedication to him. However, I don’t think I could handle living with him. I have one sister who is much older than me and studied abroad, so I grew up as an only child. I need personal space wantonly feel comfortable living with people I’m very close with. I do love my bf though and want to stay with him. Maybe with time I could become close to his brother, but I do have doubts. I know it’s selfish and I’m very thorn. The brother wouldn’t feel comfortable in a special home with outside care since he’s so high functioning, but he doesn’t have the skills to live on his own. I don’t know if this is the kind of environment I would want to bring up kids in, but my bf is amazing. I’ve always imagined a future with him.
I’d really appreciate some advice and help figuring this out.
Tl;dr: my partner of 3 years has a disabled sibling to whom he will most likely become caretaker. I’m not sure if I could handle the responsibility and it’s eating me up."
phd,"I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in computer science in the United States. My original intent was to gain research experience to decide whether I would like to do a PhD or work in the industry. My general area of interest is the intersection of computer science and psychiatry. I am interested in building digital tools that will better the lives of people suffering from mental illness.

I personally enjoy the literature review and manuscript drafting process. While I have published 7 papers so far since my undergrad, I have noticed a very worrying pattern that makes me doubt my ability to survive a PhD program. I started out in Computer Architecture during my undergrad, and also did some independent research in Machine Learning for some course projects. Towards the end of my undergrad, I got really fed up with the back and forth process of peer review while submitting article to a small journal. After working as a software engineer at a networks company, I regained my interest in research after reading some academic texts on psychology.

So I got myself enrolled in a Master's program and volunteered as a research assistant at two labs that were doing some exciting work relevant to my interests (at the time). However, things proceeded really slowly and I got bored going through the literature trying to figure out how to carry out my tasks. I eventually ended up ghosting both advisors and signed up to another medical lab. Work here was decent for a while, I implemented a large data collection pipeline from scratch and my work won a Best Poster Award at some conference. On the side as part of my coursework, I did a pretty solid NLP project that got published at a premier conference. Things were going well...

However, after taking up a new project in the same lab, I hit a massive road block. Since my advisor has a clinical background, he was not able to provide the technical support/guidance I required, which is not his fault AT ALL. I just didn't feel like reading anything related to the project and it felt really frustrating to go into the office everyday and achieve practically nothing after 6-7 hours of intense wall staring (FOR 2 MONTHS!!). Out of guilt, I started contributing to other research projects that were not technical. I felt like I couldn't do real research and started looking for full time jobs (to no avail in this current market).

Recently, my lab started interactions with another CS lab to foster collaborations. Getting hold of other researchers that have no real incentive to help you out is really tough. But things finally came through and I got to sit down with someone who had some familiarity with the type of data I was working with. It was a a very fruitful discussion and I feel reinvigorated to work on the project again with a slightly clear path ahead.

But my time to decide about what I want to do is limited as I will be graduating next year in May. Looking back, I feel like I have a problem grappling with the uncertainty of research. Despite my prior accomplishments, this cycle of getting demotivated, depressed and being super unproductive makes me wonder whether I can really thrive in an isolated environment that is a PhD. Any advice and thoughts would be appreciated."
prorevenge,"I’m crossposting this from TIFU. I’m really not a mean person and genuinely felt terrible for destroying a marriage. But the lovely users thought I should post here though I didn’t mean for the revenge to go to this level by any means. I don’t even know if I meant for revenge at all… but here we are.

I (42 F) TIFU big time. 2 weeks ago on a random Thursday morning at like 1AM someone starting shooting off fireworks in my neighborhood. I’ve been having bouts of insomnia and was finally able to get to sleep and I had to get to wake up at 4AM for a meeting 2 hours away that I had to be at for 8AM. I was pissed and so we’re my dogs. I love fireworks but think there’s a time and a place. Thursday morning at 1AM is not it.

I posted to the neighborhood fb group a few hours later during a coffee break about people that set off fireworks at 1AM mid-week.

After I make the long drive home, I check my fb. Some guy comments that I can’t sleep because I’m a fat pig. Now, I’m chubby but not sloppy fat. Plus I just lost the equivalent of a fully grown male wombat, or 54 North American grey squirrels, so I feel fucking awesome about myself.

This is where I may have really fucked up…

I respond to the guy, who was maybe mid to late 30’s/very early 40’s. About the same age group as me. I write in a comment beneath his, “Listen guys name I’m sorry I had to end things, but I just didn’t have the same feelings. What you’re saying now is just hurtful and mean. Please stop sending me messages and commenting on my fb posts is just a pathetic way to contact me. I told you a dozen times already, we are done. It’s over.”

The following day I had to get to the airport for an out of country vacation that had me getting up early and leaving early as hell… so I don’t check my fb during all the craziness (also because I’m only on it sparingly. I don’t live on my phone and when I am, I’m usually on Reddit or TikTok vs FB).

I could not check my fb even if I wanted. I was on a cruise- not paying $25/day for internet and the country we visited didn’t really have the greatest Wi-Fi. Besides I was having a blast leaving the chaos of the world behind.

I signed on Monday night and FUCK. Apparently, people took this seriously and told his wife! She was freaking out on me, pleading for information. Sending me messages. Her and his friends were DMing me. He was DMing me. It was bad.

The last message was the guy saying I’m a total cunt because I refused to tell the truth and I just destroyed his life. I immediately message both him and his wife explaining what happened. I sent pics of me on vacation even - time stamped.

Apparently, he is a serial cheater and when I exposed our affair, another woman exposed her affair with the husband to the wife because AP was jealous that he had yet another side chick. This was the straw that broke the camel’s back because not only of the multiple affairs, but because he humiliated her with how public it was (especially it being a neighborhood group).

So there’s my accidental pro revenge.

TLDR; someone tried to hurt my feelings after I posted about fireworks being set off early morning, and I pretended to publicly address our “breakup”… his wife and affair partner were not pleased."
TwoXChromosomes,"We’ve been married for 12 years, when we met I was 23 and he was turning 31. I never thought the age gap was much of a problem but as I get older I realize how much growing up I still had to do and have done in the years we’ve been together.

My husband tends to snap at me when I say/do something he doesn’t like and he also tends to pout like a child. I will concede that he comes from a family where everybody does this - I’ve spent a lot of time with them, they’re all like this. He also has diagnosed ADHD he’s on meds for and I hear that this can have an effect on the way you react to criticism, can lead to a lack of impulse control etc. Sometimes when I say literally one thing he doesn’t like or (deservedly) call him out on something he will immediately get extremely defensive, blow up at me and then accuse me of “ruining the day/evening/trip”. For the longest time I would feel really guilty and like I’m a Debbie downer of some sort. Maybe I was just a nag who makes a big deal out of nothing?

The most recent example I can think of is when his cousin visited for a few hours and the two of them decided to hit the town for a bit. At this time I was putting our 4yo to bed and when I left his bedroom, my husband was gone. He hadn’t said goodbye to me or anything. We literally never do this. When I texted him to ask why he thought it was okay to just walk out without even saying goodbye he blew up at me, told me I was making a big deal out of nothing and thanked me for “ruining his night”.

As I get older, I realize that his anger management problem is not my responsibility. It’s not my fault that he’s unable to react to me expressing absolutely normal thoughts and emotions like a mature person. If he takes half a day to “get over it” that’s not my problem either. I have been telling him so. It’s so incredibly freeing to realize that I’m not the issue - he is. I’ve been going about my day/evening happy as a clam while he sulks. He was really taken aback the first few times when I just didn’t try to “fix it” or backed down in any way. It’s been about a year that I’ve come to this realization and it’s just been liberating. I no longer take the bait to start a bigger argument. I just stick to my guns: “you messed up and I’m upset. I’m sorry it’s hard for you to hear this. Perhaps you could seek help to work on your anger management and conflict resolution skills because this kind of reaction is not normal.” And beyond that I just will not engage.

It’s okay to hold your partner to certain standards. It’s okay to call them out if they mess up. It’s okay if they’re upset at you. They can get over it in their own time! I can’t wait to see what kind of other wisdom will come with age lol

"
tifu,"TL;DR TIFU by essentially telling my girlfriend that my type was the exact opposite of her. Sad times ensue.

Obligatory “happened a couple months ago,” but realized I fucked up this morning.

Some time back, I brought up the topic of ‘types.’ I mentioned it because her best friend and I seem to damn near be the exact same individual, just of different genders, and I joked that she must have a type.

She took it a bit more seriously than I intended and proceeded to tell me she wasn’t sure she had a type, but she did like it when men were comfortable with expressing femininity, and that she thought tattoos were cool. Then she asked me my type, and I told her that generally it’s been curvy blondes with long hair, big chests and blue eyes. She lightly teased me for having basic tastes and we moved on.

The past couple of months, she’s been asking for constant reassurance. Asking if I’m sure I like her immediately after moments of intimacy, asking if I find her attractive, etc. She also stopped coming with me to the gym, which was strange because she loves weightlifting, and has lost a lot of her muscle tone.

This morning, a woman walked past our car at a red light. I sincerely didn’t notice her, but my girlfriend said, “Wow, look at her. She’s exactly your type.” I hadn’t thought about that conversation since it happened, but everything made sense, instantly. I told my girlfriend that she was my type, she said, “Not even close” and started crying. I have only seen her cry one other time in the four years I’ve known her.

My girlfriend is tall, flat-chested, muscular and has short brown hair and brown eyes. She’s beautifully androgynous and occasionally people mistake her for a very pretty teenage boy. (I love and am attracted to every bit of this about her more than any other ‘type’ that exists because she’s her.)

She said when she spoke about her type, she said she described a vague style pretty much anyone could embody (and I do dress and style myself a bit adventurously for a man), meanwhile I described an individual person she was in no way similar to, but always felt like she was expected to be. She said she couldn’t go to the gym anymore because she’d tell herself I was checking out other girls (I glance sometimes but not egregiously, and we used to do this together) and all she could think about was how unlike my ideal she was.

That one throwaway conversation has been eating away at and completely wrecked her self-esteem for months and I only just realized. Looking back, she definitely did try to bring it up once before early on, and I brushed it off with “you’re perfect for me baby don’t worry about stupid stuff” not understanding how bad she was feeling.

So yeah, I feel like I fucked up. Not sure what to do about it.
"
unpopuloropinion,"I work as a general contractor so I've been in a ton of people's homes. One recurring thing I see is mistreatment of dogs. Not outright abuse, but neglect in a way that wouldn't be reportable. I love animals and I love dogs but I hate to see the things I see.

The most common is people will have a patio or deck and that is their dog's ""yard"". They put their dog out on the deck instead of walking it. The dog then poops all over the deck and barks at who ever is walking by on the street. It can be days or weeks before the deck is ever cleaned. Many people leave their dog like this all day. I have seen this hundreds of time. One customer I had, through the middle of winter, would put their dog on a chain and let them out the front door. The entire front yard in a 20 foot circle was completely covered in frozen dog poop. They didn't clean it once during the month we renovated their house.

The next most common are having aggressive dogs that are unsafe around the general public. I'm not afraid of dogs but I have had several owners explain that their dog will attack me if they don't lock it up. If your dog is unsafe for a 6 foot tall repairman to be around even when the family is there, then your dog is not safe to have as a pet! So what happens in these cases are the people lock their dog up in a bathroom, kennel or patio and the dog furiously barks and tries to get at me the entire time I am working on their house. This is totally unsafe for guests, especially children. Unsurprisingly it is almost always a single breed. Once I had a dog break through a bathroom door, barrel downstairs and attack me while working. Fortunately it just chewed on my pants but it is not right to keep an animal like that locked up in a home where it could hurt someone.

Finally I also see a lot, confining dogs, especially large breed dogs living in tiny apartments. You may have the best intentions in the world but a 75+lb Husky should not live in a 500 square foot apartment. Animals like that need space. If you work all day you should not be keeping a dog like this locked in a kennel 8-10 hours a day. Then some people lock them up when they are sleeping too. That's 16+ hours of being locked up every day. The majority of this animals life is spent in a cage. It is inhuman. Dogs like this deserve to live in a rural household where they can get out and be free and run.

So that's my unpopular opinion. People should not feel entitled to own animals which are not a good match for their lifestyle. I believe having a pet is a privilege. You cannot truly ""own"" an animal like an object. They are a part of your family. It is your responsibility to provide it a good life for as long as it lives. This is a pact you swear when you take it home.

povertyfinance,"What do you think about food giveaway etiquette?

Here's what I am dealing with: Food Not Bombs giveaways are first come/first served. The community has three serves, located in different quadrants of the city. Food Not Bombs doesn't require ID, and it has no income stipulations. This makes it attractive to people without ID or who earn *just too much* for SNAP or the food bank. In this community, the food banks, including ALL the church giveaways, force you to sign documents and provide ID attesting to the fact that you do not earn more than 200% FPL. For people who get any kind of benefit or who have a job, lying on this form could result in benefit or job termination, as it's a federal offense to claim eligibility but not actually meet the requirements.

The serves start around 12:00-12:30pm on Saturdays. The high increase in food prices, no ID/income requirement mean these serves are popular. The amount of donated/rescued food has also decreased, especially since the US government ended the Farmers to Families and other food programs prevalent during the public health emergency around covid.

People have taken to putting a ""place holder"" on the public sidewalk at the FNB serve locations. For example, as soon as daylight breaks, people are dropping off an apron, a reusable bag, a box, a brick, a concrete block, whatever to ""hold their spot in line"" without actually standing there.

Some other people arrive around 11:00-11:30am and wait 30-90 minutes in person. They are getting very upset about the ""place holders"". If they just get in line ahead of the ""place holders"" and wait, then when those people return, they have a bitchfest about it. Some have started cussing out the people who wait in person.

The volunteers claim to have no recourse in the holding of places. They maintain first come, first served, but they also don't know if someone put their brick on the sidewalk at 7:00am or if someone arrived at 11:00am and waited in person for an hour.

So what do you think here? Is anyone in the right or wrong? How should this be handled?
